"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters.

The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, describing it as the best one they have visited worldwide.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."
"Quite underwhelmed. My mam and dad wanted to go during their visit to China because they had never been to Disney land. Me and my wife were reluctant as our baby is 1.4 yrs old, and wondered who it would really be for, cause it ainâ€™t for us. They insisted it would be fun and even the baby would love it.I was reluctant but I thought, well itâ€™s supposed to be world class isnâ€™t it. Even if the queues for the rides are preposterously long, they must have sufficient entertainment for even the adults I guess. Wrong. Aside from the morning parade which was legit cool, the rest was just rides and visual things to look at, or super expressive consumerist experiences in the shops. The rides are not even that special or enticing to me, Iâ€™ve been in a few theme parks and even the just ok rides would have you waiting an hour to an hour and a half. Thatâ€™s about a third or a quarter of the time youâ€™d spend out and about, after you omit your meals. Just bad value.I really thought thereâ€™d be magical entertainment all over, like how in the fringe fest in Edinburgh, when you walk around thereâ€™s street acts and an electric vibe. Nothing really here though except walking around at the impressive areas they created. Although those areas are visually impressive, the main thing to do it seems is go to the rides. But the wait makes it impractical and miserable. Unless you wanna go on the equivalent to the teacupsâ€¦ then good for you only 20m wait.People spend a lot of time waiting to queue just for a photo with a character. We waited half an hour just to get the baby in a photo with Mickey Mouse and I just thought this is all just a big charade isnâ€™t it. I mean why not just have a few Mickey Mouseâ€™s and other big characters wondering round the park? Why just have one and make a big deal of this mere photo opportunity, put him in a big special building for this purpose and then make you wait all that time. Why so orchestrated?I thought I might see some tricks and fun things in the streets as I walked around but I didnâ€™t. I think sometimes people pay a lot for things and then become invested so they say things were good cause they donâ€™t wanna admit they wasted money on a bad idea or that the ideas they have for passing time are actually rubbish ðŸ˜‚Finally, I didnâ€™t see anything that was very entertaining for such young babies. Like a baby play area or anything like that. It may be a bit much to expect them to cater in this regard but, who are they catering to currently? I didnâ€™t feel like it was me, and it wasnâ€™t for the babyâ€¦ so just kids? Well it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Put on more entertainment, shows, street tricks, activities",2.0,"The reviewer was disappointed with their visit to Disneyland in China. They found the entertainment to be insufficient, with long queues incompatible with the value delivered by the rides. They were expecting more of an electric vibe with street acts and found the focus mainly on rides that involved substantial waiting times. The reviewer also criticized the orchestrated photo opportunity with characters like Mickey Mouse which also involved a lengthy wait, suggesting that characters should roam around the park instead. They also mentioned a lack of facilities for very young children and suggested Disneyland should diversify its entertainment to cater beyond just kids."
"Rubbish customer service, brought the wrong size at closing time rushing for the last train at night. Went back next day to exchange and was told by a member of staff I had to buy the correct size then go to the refund desk to get a refund. After the queuing up got to told I can't refund it as I had got free gifts when I had originally purchased a lot of items the day before and to get a refund I would have to give them the gifts back. All I wanted was to change the item to correct size. Supervisor came out and started to raise her voice and told me to go find her colleague who told us we could do this. Bare in mind this place is huge. She then shoved the back of the receipt in my face and shouted at us ( we have 3 kids, in Disneyland) saying it's in Chinese and English in her broken English. I had to walk out really frustrated and angry. The lack of customer relations is ridiculous, they are definitely better Disney parks than this one. We weren't trying to con them, al I wanted was the correct size for my son. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1.0,"The review is overall negative, expressing frustration with the customer service. The reviewer bought the wrong size item in a hurry and tried to exchange it the next day, but was told they would have to buy the correct size first and then get a refund. They also encountered issues with a free gift that came with the original purchase, which the store wanted back in order to process the refund. The reviewer found the staff to be unhelpful and rude, especially a supervisor who raised her voice and was difficult to understand. The reviewer also mentioned the size of the store as an issue, felt wronged, and warns future customers to avoid this Disneyland store."
"I was super thrilled to see the first time Disneyland. It is really huge  and have variety of attractions. However, waiting for one ride can take from 1-2 hours. All day i had only 6-7 rides, when i could have more than that. Food is also little pricey. However, I enjoyed walking around and to be spectator of wonderful fireworks.",4.0,"The reviewer expressed great excitement about their first visit to Disneyland, praising its sizable area and diverse attractions. However, they were disappointed by the long waiting times for rides (1-2 hours), which resulted in them only experiencing 6-7 attractions throughout the day. They also commented that food prices were high. Despite these issues, they enjoyed strolling around the park and watching the impressive fireworks display."
"overall the experience was good. lets start from the advantages, the staff member was polite, we had a lot of fun there. but it's not recommended with no fast pass, especially the ones who wanna play the popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster (we bought one), if you wanna get to play all rides or at least half of them, a fast pass could help a lot. the average queue time for a ride could take an hour or more. Since we went in Wednesday there's not a lot of people, but sure there might be MASSVE amount of people in the summer break or other holidays.",4.0,"The reviewer had a good overall experience. They praised the polite staff and enjoyed the fun atmosphere. However, they do not recommend visiting without a fast pass, especially for popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster. To enjoy all or at least half of the rides, a fast pass is advised. The average waiting time for rides can exceed an hour. The reviewer visited on a Wednesday when it was less crowded but expects it could be extremely busy during summer breaks or holidays."
We came here straight after Paris Disney which we rated highly. Sadly July is a no to visit this place. It was local school holidays and we went on a Monday. The heat and lack of shade and indoor eating areas did us in. The lines and entrance confusion was a bad start but then the absence of shade in 39 degree heat was a no go. We did two rides and had to leave when we lined up for 40 minutes just to get into a place to eat only to then have to search for a table - after looking for a table for 20 minutes we headed home.,2.0,"The reviewer had a disappointing experience visiting an unspecified location in July, during local school holidays. The place was extremely crowded and the entry process was confusing. There was a lack of indoor eating areas and shade, which made the visit uncomfortable in the 39-degree heat. Long queuing times, both for rides and restaurants, made the experience even worse and led to them leaving early."
"The walk to the entrance if by tour bus is half an hour. Once you get to the gate area, there's so many zigzag barriers that even on a not so busy day, you have to walk round and round on what otherwise would only be a few steps without the barriers.This is the first Disneyland I've been to where you're allowed to bring in food.Rides and queues inside are otherwise orderly.  I only saw 3 people spitting on the ground (I was expecting more).  A few people were smoking outside the designated smoking areas.We spent 2 days here.  This can actually be experienced in a day.",4.0,"The reviewer highlights that getting to the park's entrance can be a bit lengthy if traveling by tour bus, taking around half an hour. The park's entrance layout includes many zigzag barriers which add unnecessary distance, even on quieter days. They also mention that contrary to other Disneyland locations, you can bring in your own food. Rides and queues are organized and relatively clean, with only a few instances of inappropriate behavior like spitting and smoking observed. Despite spending 2 days, the reviewer believes that the park can be fully experienced within a single day."
A below average Disneyland experience despite excellent hardware. I had fast pass to save time but still felt like I was a semi-finished good in a conveyance belt. My feeling is that 50% of the staffs didnâ€™t make guests feel welcoming and 70% has no smile on their face.Personally I disliked most is smoking. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see people smoking in non-smoking areas and the staffs appeared that they didnâ€™t care. This is extremely disturbing for a non-smoker like myself,3.0,"The reviewer had an unsatisfying experience at Disneyland, despite using a fast pass to expedite queue times. They found the staff unwelcoming, with a majority not smiling or engaging positively with guests. The reviewer was also annoyed by the widespread smoking in non-smoking areas, which was not addressed by staff, creating an uncomfortable environment for them as a non-smoker."
"It was rainy, hot, and humid so I wouldn't recommend going in June. BUT the air conditioning was excellent once you got into buildings. The Zootopia area is incredible and so cute! I also loved the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show. So amazing! This is a wonderful park. Loved it!",5.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience due to rainy, hot and humid weather in June, however, they enjoyed the excellent air conditioning inside the buildings.

Good  but was quite disappointed with the handling of the queues for the shows by the staff and the waiting period was terrible. People were cutting lies trying to go over you and the entertainment shows were hardly 15 minutes. I would give it an average and Please note that seating areas to rest yourself are very limited. During peak hours it's a really killer. Dining was average to but there was a really good pastry shop in mickeys downtown. There were too many characters as well.  Shopping was excellent bur crowd control could be managed better.,3.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience. They were disappointed with the handling of queues for shows and the long waiting periods, expressing dissatisfaction with the short duration of entertainment shows.

They appreciated the shopping experience but felt crowd control could have been better managed. Overall, they rated the experience as average."
"Get harassed by all the illegal toads right infront of the Disney entrance, inside Disney and upon exit to try sell you all toys, service,etc. Super irritating.The working Crew are a huge turn off during our entry and during the games. Most of the staffs mostly dont live up to Disney name. They are rude and unhelpful. If you speak foreign lauggage here then good luck to you..I keep seing people either fight, quarrel or police came to escort people out from the park. Disaster.... this will be my first and last to visit the Shanghai Disney. Will not recommend anyone here unless you just wanna come here for Instagram than to enjoy a real theme park ride.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience at Shanghai Disney due to aggressive vendors outside and inside the entrance.

"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters. Mickey and Goofy discover a magic book, encountering Olaf, Baloo, King Louie, Moana, Mulan, and others along the way, with live music mainly in Chinese and some English songs.Golden Fairytale FanfareAn outdoor show in front of the Enchanted Storybook Castle featuring Snow White, Elsa, Anna, Jasmine, Aladdin, Ariel, Merida, and more, with English songs.Mickey’s Storybook ExpressA 14-minute character parade with numerous Disney favorites.ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime CelebrationA projection mapping show at the Enchanted Storybook Castle with fireworks, fountains, lasers, and Disney and Marvel characters.DiningMickey & Pals Market Café•	Ma La Tang Noodle Soup with Prawn and Beef (¥119) + Dumplings (¥30) - Spicy, tongue-tingling soup with beef slices and shrimp.•	Roasted Spring Chicken with Vegetables (¥129) - Sweet, roasted chicken with a tomato-edamame side.Barbossa’s Bounty•	Barbossa Feast for 2 (¥299) - Grilled squid, ribs, and chicken with two servings of rice; overall, it has a sweet flavor.Zootopia Market•	Disney Zootopia Pawpsicle (¥45) - A sweet and tangy fruit popsicle, perfect for a warm day.RidesPirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken TreasureA boat ride through scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean, with forward, backward, and rotating movements. The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening. Note: photos must be downloaded within 90 days, or they’re deleted automatically.Overall, my day at Shanghai Disneyland was filled with memorable shows, tasty food, thrilling rides, and unique photo ops.",5.0,"The user visited Shanghai Disneyland and had a highly detailed and immersive experience.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, describing it as the best one they have visited worldwide. They enjoyed the lack of crowds in mid-October and the cleanliness and maintenance of the park. The reviewer appreciated the value of the food and souvenirs and the diverse selection at various cafes and restaurants. They also noted the friendly staff and felt safe leaving their belongings around the park. They were pleased that the park's rides were suitable for their young children, although noted some height restrictions. The Toy Story Hotel, closely located to Disneyland was a convenient place to stay, offering early access benefits.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."
"Quite underwhelmed. My mam and dad wanted to go during their visit to China because they had never been to Disney land. Me and my wife were reluctant as our baby is 1.4 yrs old, and wondered who it would really be for, cause it ainâ€™t for us. They insisted it would be fun and even the baby would love it.I was reluctant but I thought, well itâ€™s supposed to be world class isnâ€™t it. Even if the queues for the rides are preposterously long, they must have sufficient entertainment for even the adults I guess. Wrong. Aside from the morning parade which was legit cool, the rest was just rides and visual things to look at, or super expressive consumerist experiences in the shops. The rides are not even that special or enticing to me, Iâ€™ve been in a few theme parks and even the just ok rides would have you waiting an hour to an hour and a half. Thatâ€™s about a third or a quarter of the time youâ€™d spend out and about, after you omit your meals. Just bad value.I really thought thereâ€™d be magical entertainment all over, like how in the fringe fest in Edinburgh, when you walk around thereâ€™s street acts and an electric vibe. Nothing really here though except walking around at the impressive areas they created. Although those areas are visually impressive, the main thing to do it seems is go to the rides. But the wait makes it impractical and miserable. Unless you wanna go on the equivalent to the teacupsâ€¦ then good for you only 20m wait.People spend a lot of time waiting to queue just for a photo with a character. We waited half an hour just to get the baby in a photo with Mickey Mouse and I just thought this is all just a big charade isnâ€™t it. I mean why not just have a few Mickey Mouseâ€™s and other big characters wondering round the park? Why just have one and make a big deal of this mere photo opportunity, put him in a big special building for this purpose and then make you wait all that time. Why so orchestrated?I thought I might see some tricks and fun things in the streets as I walked around but I didnâ€™t. I think sometimes people pay a lot for things and then become invested so they say things were good cause they donâ€™t wanna admit they wasted money on a bad idea or that the ideas they have for passing time are actually rubbish ðŸ˜‚Finally, I didnâ€™t see anything that was very entertaining for such young babies. Like a baby play area or anything like that. It may be a bit much to expect them to cater in this regard but, who are they catering to currently? I didnâ€™t feel like it was me, and it wasnâ€™t for the babyâ€¦ so just kids? Well it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Put on more entertainment, shows, street tricks, activities",2.0,"The reviewer was disappointed with their visit to Disneyland in China. They found the entertainment to be insufficient, with long queues incompatible with the value delivered by the rides. They were expecting more of an electric vibe with street acts and found the focus mainly on rides that involved substantial waiting times. The reviewer also criticized the orchestrated photo opportunity with characters like Mickey Mouse which also involved a lengthy wait, suggesting that characters should roam around the park instead. They also mentioned a lack of facilities for very young children and suggested Disneyland should diversify its entertainment to cater beyond just kids."
"Rubbish customer service, brought the wrong size at closing time rushing for the last train at night. Went back next day to exchange and was told by a member of staff I had to buy the correct size then go to the refund desk to get a refund. After the queuing up got to told I can't refund it as I had got free gifts when I had originally purchased a lot of items the day before and to get a refund I would have to give them the gifts back. All I wanted was to change the item to correct size. Supervisor came out and started to raise her voice and told me to go find her colleague who told us we could do this. Bare in mind this place is huge. She then shoved the back of the receipt in my face and shouted at us ( we have 3 kids, in Disneyland) saying it's in Chinese and English in her broken English. I had to walk out really frustrated and angry. The lack of customer relations is ridiculous, they are definitely better Disney parks than this one. We weren't trying to con them, al I wanted was the correct size for my son. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1.0,"The review is overall negative, expressing frustration with the customer service. The reviewer bought the wrong size item in a hurry and tried to exchange it the next day, but was told they would have to buy the correct size first and then get a refund. They also encountered issues with a free gift that came with the original purchase, which the store wanted back in order to process the refund. The reviewer found the staff to be unhelpful and rude, especially a supervisor who raised her voice and was difficult to understand. The reviewer also mentioned the size of the store as an issue, felt wronged, and warns future customers to avoid this Disneyland store."
"I was super thrilled to see the first time Disneyland. It is really huge  and have variety of attractions. However, waiting for one ride can take from 1-2 hours. All day i had only 6-7 rides, when i could have more than that. Food is also little pricey. However, I enjoyed walking around and to be spectator of wonderful fireworks.",4.0,"The reviewer expressed great excitement about their first visit to Disneyland, praising its sizable area and diverse attractions. However, they were disappointed by the long waiting times for rides (1-2 hours), which resulted in them only experiencing 6-7 attractions throughout the day. They also commented that food prices were high. Despite these issues, they enjoyed strolling around the park and watching the impressive fireworks display."
"overall the experience was good. lets start from the advantages, the staff member was polite, we had a lot of fun there. but it's not recommended with no fast pass, especially the ones who wanna play the popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster (we bought one), if you wanna get to play all rides or at least half of them, a fast pass could help a lot. the average queue time for a ride could take an hour or more. Since we went in Wednesday there's not a lot of people, but sure there might be MASSVE amount of people in the summer break or other holidays.",4.0,"The reviewer had a good overall experience. They praised the polite staff and enjoyed the fun atmosphere. However, they do not recommend visiting without a fast pass, especially for popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster. To enjoy all or at least half of the rides, a fast pass is advised. The average waiting time for rides can exceed an hour. The reviewer visited on a Wednesday when it was less crowded but expects it could be extremely busy during summer breaks or holidays."
We came here straight after Paris Disney which we rated highly. Sadly July is a no to visit this place. It was local school holidays and we went on a Monday. The heat and lack of shade and indoor eating areas did us in. The lines and entrance confusion was a bad start but then the absence of shade in 39 degree heat was a no go. We did two rides and had to leave when we lined up for 40 minutes just to get into a place to eat only to then have to search for a table - after looking for a table for 20 minutes we headed home.,2.0,"The reviewer had a disappointing experience visiting an unspecified location in July, during local school holidays. The place was extremely crowded and the entry process was confusing. There was a lack of indoor eating areas and shade, which made the visit uncomfortable in the 39-degree heat. Long queuing times, both for rides and restaurants, made the experience even worse and led to them leaving early."
"The walk to the entrance if by tour bus is half an hour. Once you get to the gate area, there's so many zigzag barriers that even on a not so busy day, you have to walk round and round on what otherwise would only be a few steps without the barriers.This is the first Disneyland I've been to where you're allowed to bring in food.Rides and queues inside are otherwise orderly.  I only saw 3 people spitting on the ground (I was expecting more).  A few people were smoking outside the designated smoking areas.We spent 2 days here.  This can actually be experienced in a day.",4.0,"The reviewer highlights that getting to the park's entrance can be a bit lengthy if traveling by tour bus, taking around half an hour. The park's entrance layout includes many zigzag barriers which add unnecessary distance, even on quieter days. They also mention that contrary to other Disneyland locations, you can bring in your own food. Rides and queues are organized and relatively clean, with only a few instances of inappropriate behavior like spitting and smoking observed. Despite spending 2 days, the reviewer believes that the park can be fully experienced within a single day."
A below average Disneyland experience despite excellent hardware. I had fast pass to save time but still felt like I was a semi-finished good in a conveyance belt. My feeling is that 50% of the staffs didnâ€™t make guests feel welcoming and 70% has no smile on their face.Personally I disliked most is smoking. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see people smoking in non-smoking areas and the staffs appeared that they didnâ€™t care. This is extremely disturbing for a non-smoker like myself,3.0,"The reviewer had an unsatisfying experience at Disneyland, despite using a fast pass to expedite queue times. They found the staff unwelcoming, with a majority not smiling or engaging positively with guests. The reviewer was also annoyed by the widespread smoking in non-smoking areas, which was not addressed by staff, creating an uncomfortable environment for them as a non-smoker."
"It was rainy, hot, and humid so I wouldn't recommend going in June. BUT the air conditioning was excellent once you got into buildings. The Zootopia area is incredible and so cute! I also loved the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show. So amazing! This is a wonderful park. Loved it!",5.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience due to rainy, hot and humid weather in June, however, they enjoyed the excellent air conditioning inside the buildings. Highlights included the ""incredible"" Zootopia area, the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show, which they found amazing. Despite the weather, they considered the park wonderful and loved their visit."
Good  but was quite disappointed with the handling of the queues for the shows by the staff and the waiting period was terrible. People were cutting lies trying to go over you and the entertainment shows were hardly 15 minutes. I would give it an average and Please note that seating areas to rest yourself are very limited. During peak hours it's a really killer. Dining was average to but there was a really good pastry shop in mickeys downtown. There were too many characters as well.  Shopping was excellent bur crowd control could be managed better.,3.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience. They were disappointed with the handling of queues for shows and the long waiting periods, expressing dissatisfaction with the short duration of entertainment shows. They noted that seating areas were limited especially during peak hours and found dining average. They enjoyed a good pastry shop in Mickey's downtown but felt there were too many characters. They appreciated the shopping experience but felt crowd control could have been better managed. Overall, they rated the experience as average."
"Get harassed by all the illegal toads right infront of the Disney entrance, inside Disney and upon exit to try sell you all toys, service,etc. Super irritating.The working Crew are a huge turn off during our entry and during the games. Most of the staffs mostly dont live up to Disney name. They are rude and unhelpful. If you speak foreign lauggage here then good luck to you..I keep seing people either fight, quarrel or police came to escort people out from the park. Disaster.... this will be my first and last to visit the Shanghai Disney. Will not recommend anyone here unless you just wanna come here for Instagram than to enjoy a real theme park ride.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience at Shanghai Disney due to aggressive vendors outside and inside the entrance. They were disappointed with the staff, who they found to be rude and unhelpful, especially towards those speaking foreign languages. They also noted frequent disturbances, such as fights and police interventions. They would not recommend visiting Shanghai Disney unless it was merely for Instagram photos and not for an enjoyable theme park experience. This was their first and will be their last visit to the park."
"We went on a non holiday week day in June, but the lines are too long. Even to just to get into the park took nearly 40 mins. You can buy speed pass (180 Yuan per person per ride). For a family of 3, you can end up spending a lot of money or wait >1 hour for each ride. Overall I would say it would say it is not worth going. My child had more fun at the Shanghai aquarium.",2.0,"The reviewer visited a park during a non-holiday weekday in June and found the lines extremely long, with a wait time of approximately 40 minutes merely to enter the park. They suggest that while speed passes are available at 180 Yuan per ride, it led to high expenses for their family of three. They found the park not worth the visit, mentioning that their child enjoyed their trip to the Shanghai aquarium more."
"My recent experience at Shanghai Disneyland left me deeply disappointed and frustrated due to several concerning issues that significantly marred what should have been a magical visit.Secondhand Smoke Everywhere: Despite designated smoking zones, the park is overrun with inconsiderate visitors who openly smoke wherever they please, subjecting everyone, especially children, to the dangers of secondhand smoke. This blatant disregard for the rules and lack of courtesy from some Chinese guests made navigating the park a challenge and significantly impacted our enjoyment.Illegal Peddlers: Shockingly, just outside the Disney shops, illegal peddlers openly sell Disney merchandise, directly undermining the integrity of the park's retail experience. It's incomprehensible how Disney allows such activities to persist, tarnishing the authenticity and trust associated with its brand.Annual Pass Holder Abuse: Throughout the park, we encountered aggressive annual pass holders exploiting their privileges to engage in unlawful behavior. These individuals relentlessly pestered guests to purchase Disney merchandise through them, falsely promising discounts and circumventing proper queues. It became evident that they were exploiting their pass holder status to undercut Disney, all in pursuit of personal gain and the advancement of their membership tiers.Overall, my visit to Shanghai Disneyland was marred by these unacceptable issues, detracting from what should have been a magical experience. It's disheartening to witness such blatant disregard for rules and ethics within the confines of a place meant to inspire joy and wonder. I sincerely hope that management takes swift and decisive action to address these issues and uphold the standards of excellence that Disney is known for.",1.0,"The review describes a disappointing and frustrating experience at Shanghai Disneyland due to instances of rule-breaking and unethical behavior. The issues mentioned include rampant smoking outside of designated areas, illegal vendors selling Disney merchandise outside official shops and aggressive annual pass holders exploiting their privileges for personal gain. These situations contributed to a poor visit and the reviewer urges the management to take action."
The park is awesome like all disney parks. But even on a weekday its too tooo tooo crowded. You end up waiting 40 mins for one ride. Try and book fast track if available and just avoid weekends. Access is also easy by metro and car.,4.0,"The reviewer loves the park, noting it's as fantastic as other Disney parks. However, they report that it's extremely crowded even on weekdays, causing long wait times for rides. They suggest booking fast track tickets if possible and avoiding weekends. They also note that the park is easily accessible by metro and car."
"We visited during a Chinese school holiday, which meant it was very crowded and the queues very long. Food and drink was expensive, For example, Â£6.00 for a pineapple flavoured ice cream cone.A bit of a faff organising admission passes and fast passes and you must take your passport.We quite enjoyed the visit and obviously, being Disney there is plenty to see , to do and it is pleasant to walk around. At nighttime the best viewing areas get extremely crowded, so find a good spot early and hang on to it.",4.0,"The reviewer visited during a Chinese school holiday, which resulted in significant crowds and long queues.

However, they advised that the best viewing areas at night get extremely crowded and recommend securing a good spot early."
"We had one day at the Park on a free day during part of a 10 day tour of China.  As this was the only DIsney park in the world I hadn't yet been to, I was very keen to visit, and I wasn't disappointed.We ordered our tickets online the night before, and I was able to easily pay with a foreign (non-Chinese) travel card. (A fellow traveller did have a few issues with their card, but they were eventually able to finalise the transaction). The tickets were then linked to our passports, so it is very important to remember to take your passport with you as this is now your entry ticket.We visited on a weekday in mid November, and arrived just before opening time. Entry was quick and easy (including bag inspections).  A lot of the rides were walk-on with minimal wait times during the morning. It became a bit busier in the afternoon, but was still very manageable. (This was the complete opposite of Tokyo Disneyland a few years ago, which was horrendously overcrowded all three days we were there, during the so-called ""off peak"" time. Never again).The Park was beautiful, clean and easy to navigate.  Our ticket included a free meal and drink, which was great value. I chose spaghetti and meatballs, which was huge and filled me up for the day. The menu prices seemed quite reasonable, especially for a Disney park. We bought the PhotoPass, and had some issues trying to get it to work/download, but the staff in the photo shop were amazingly patient and helpful in getting it to finally work.I was disappointed to discover Pirates of the Caribbean was closed, but it's a great excuse to revisit in the future!",5.0,"The user had a positive experience visiting the Disney park during a one-day break on their 10-day tour of China.

After we waited and argued for more than an hour they just let us enter.?",2.0,The reviewer had a negative experience with the gate staff who initially denied them entry due to ticket issues. They had to wait and argue for over an hour before being allowed in.
"Good:1. Quite a big park with a good variety of rides, performances and F&B outlets; Facilities are good overall.2. F&B doesn't cost an arm and a leg like some other parks.3. Relatively well organised and efficiently run park.Bad:1. Most service staff do not seem motivated to give visitors a good experience, they do not smile and their greetings are monotone; Compared to the other Disney parks in the region, the service level is far behind.2. Security officers behave like thugs, barking at visitors during the night event. I understand the need for crowd control, but I've never seen such unruly behavior even from actual law enforcement officers, much less a bunch of security staff.Conclusion:Great activities and rides only form part of the experience, great service is what truly makes Disneyland a magical experience, Unfortunately this is missing in Shanghai Disneyland.",2.0,"The reviewer praises Shanghai Disneyland for its large size, variety of rides, performances, and food and beverage outlets, as well as reasonable pricing for food and drink. The reviewer also appreciates that the park is well-organized and efficiently run. However, they criticize the staff for lacking motivation, rarely smiling, and offering monotone greetings, which they claim is noticeably worse compared to other Disney parks. They also criticize the security officers for being rude and behaving inappropriately during the night event. The reviewer concludes that while the park offers great activities and rides, the poor service detracts from the overall experience."
"Believe it or not, the max we had to queue for any ride was 20 minutes. That was because we went on a rainy day, and the day before Zootopia opened so that kept the crowds away somewhat we think. Having gone to Paris, Hong Kong and LA, this was probably the best experience we had - ever - just because the queues for any ride was so short!Food was better at Universal Resorts Beijing, but the overall experience here cannot be beat. My kids' favourite ride was Roaring Rapids and Tron - Soaring Over The Horizon also rated quite highly too!",5.0,"The review suggests a highly positive experience at the park, attributing the minimal 20-minutes queue times to rainy weather and a new attraction launch on the following day. Comparing it to previous trips to Paris, Hong Kong, and LA, the user found this visit the best thanks chiefly to short queues. While they considered the food better at Universal Resorts Beijing, the overall experience at this place was unbeatable. The reviewer's kids specifically enjoyed the Roaring Rapids and Tron rides, with Soaring Over The Horizon also earning high praise."
"I loved this park, itâ€™s got that Disney charm but just takes the rides up to the next level.Letâ€™s start with the rides: Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron just take the rides up that notch. Pirates in particular is insane about just how immersive it really is, this isnâ€™t the pirates youâ€™re used to but it just blows your mind as youâ€™re going around.The park is stunning and the theming is beautiful throughout and is topped off by the beautiful castle as itâ€™s centre. Having watched vlogs and seen pictures before visiting, I was a little worried I was going to be disappointed and it wouldnâ€™t have a charm as it was so big; I shouldnâ€™t have been worried at all. The castle is perfect and the area around it is different to other Disneyâ€™s which provides great viewing areas for the nightly shows.My only slight negative is, this park is big! It doesnâ€™t have the same charm in some areas as itâ€™s smaller counterparts. For example, Fantasyland is spread out so doesnâ€™t have the same â€˜villageâ€™ type appearance as others.Also, I canâ€™t wait to see what they do with this park in future. Itâ€™s clearly been built with expansion in mind so look forward to seeing how it matures and progresses.",4.0,"The reviewer highly enjoyed the park and was particularly impressed by its advanced and immersive rides, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron. They appreciated the beautiful surroundings, especially the stunning castle and its surrounding areas, which offer excellent views for nightly shows. While they were initially uncertain about the park's large size, they found that most of it was well-designed and charming. They had minor criticisms about some sections, like Fantasyland, losing a bit of charm due to the park's scale. The reviewer anticipates future expansions, believing that the park was built with room for growth."
"This was our second visit, after our first which was in 2016.The place is still as magical as ever!The rides are awesome, if only the queues were not horrendous. Mind you, we went during the national holiday, so it was to be expected. If you don't mind paying for the express lane, and the queue is above 60 minutes, I'd say it is absolutely worth spending your money to shorten the queue and save yourself from the exhaustion of standing in the queue. If you are up for the thrill, I'd strongly suggest Tron ride at the Tomorrowland.We came on the first day of October and were absolutely delighted to see the wonderful Halloween decorations and souvenirs around the park.The cleanliness of the entire place is top notch, including every toilet we had been, even with the park being so crowded. I am super thankful for all the family toilet they have provided in every toilet, it makes it a breeze to bring a toddler to the park, when it comes to changing their diapers or cleaning the up.Another perk that I love is that we can bring an empty drinking bottle to the park, as there always a drinking fountain/tap to refill our bottle situated nearby the toilets.I am excited and hoping that the new Zootopia Land will be completed and opened soon. We would love to return again one day.",5.0,"The reviewer had a great second visit to the amusement park, noting its magical atmosphere and excellent rides. However, they encountered long queues, especially during the national holiday. They recommended using the express lane to avoid long waits if it's above an hour. The place was clean, even during a crowded day, with family-friendly facilities. They particularly appreciated the option to refill their bottles at numerous drinking fountains. They loved the decorations during their visit on the first day of October, especially the Halloween theme. They eagerly await the opening of the new Zootopia Land and intend to revisit."
"Weâ€™re a couple from the UK and big Disney fans. Weâ€™d booked  holiday to China which ended in Shanghai and we decided to visit Disneyland. I tried doing a bit of research about the place which in the end didnâ€™t prove that helpful. Firstly, downloading the app and buying the tickets online - we downloaded the app whilst in the UK. Tickets were only available/released 10 days to two weeks in advance so donâ€™t worry if your date isnâ€™t showing for a months time. The app was very slow whether in the UK or in China but worked much better in China on a Chinese Wi-Fi. Due to the timings we had to wait until we were in China to book the tickets on the app. Iâ€™d read things about huge queues so opted for one of the premier access (fast pass) packages. It cost us Â£300 for two one day park tickets with six fast passes each. The fast passes were ride specific and there are different options depending on the rides you want. You can also buy individual fast passes. Iâ€™d read about huge queues and didnâ€™t want to rely on free fast passes that we might not get so thatâ€™s why I opted for the package. We also bought a one day PhotoPass for around Â£25. Once youâ€™ve bought the tickets in the app itâ€™ll say youâ€™ll get a text and email confirmation for the purchase but I got neither but had took screen shots just in case. The purchase will appear on your app, go to the â€˜meâ€™ section at the bottom where youâ€™ll have to fill in the guest names and passport numbers of the guests for each ticket. YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PASSPORTS WITH YOU. All tickets in China seem to be attached to your passports for security reasons and you wonâ€™t be let in without your passports. They will then give you a paper ticket once at the turnstile at the entrance to the park and you wonâ€™t need your passports again. The PhotoPass is a coupon on the app that youâ€™ll need to get redeemed in the park at one of several locations, it tells you where in the app but we went to cosy corner, itâ€™s the first shop on your right on Mickey Avenue (what would normally be Main Street USA). Youâ€™ll need to download the Disney PhotoPass app too which is where your photos will appear, the cast members will help you and show you. Regardless of whether youâ€™ve had the pass activated, the first time you get to a photographer youâ€™ll be given a card with a QR code on which will be scanned like your band would be in Orlando, every time they take a photo and all photos will appear on the app. You can purchase individual prints of photos at the park or you can have them digitally by buying the PhotoPass. It shows you the photo opportunities on the map of the park in the app. When we went there was no paper map, itâ€™s all on the app. We went on Saturday 16 September which was after the school holidays. Despite it being a Saturday it wasnâ€™t too busy. The longest queue time was 60mins for the seven dwarves mine train which we had a fast pass for. Tron had a 30 minute wait time and so we queued once for it and used the fast pass the next time. Pirates of the Caribbean had a 15 minute wait time so we queued and did that twice too. We got straight on the crystal grotto and queued half an hour for Peter Pan. We went to the Pirates of the Caribbean stunt show which isnâ€™t in English but was still worth seeing (bear with it). Meeting characters has longer wait times for 40-60 minutes, which we didnâ€™t bother with. Another thing to add, no commentary is in English on any of the rides. The parade does have English bits mainly due to the songs, same with the nighttime illuminations at the castle. The park in general is bigger than I thought, I thought it would be on a par with Paris but it was bigger. It has five (I think) lands to it, each has a guest services which have a board up telling you show times etc. Thereâ€™s plenty of western style food, we had pizza from the Pinocchio tavern and we saw burgers in the restaurant in Tomorrowland. Thereâ€™s free water fountains throughout the park and the water tastes normal (not like the matchstick flavoured water of Orlando). Disneytown is the food and shopping area (like a mini Disney Springs) and has the only Starbucks in the park (which doesnâ€™t do anything Disney themed) but is big with indoor and outdoor seating. It is on the side of the park as if another land but you have to pass through security to get in and out of the park, the queue was minimal on the day we went. Itâ€™s hot and humid so prepare for this, my hair turned wild and my Disney themed T-shirt was stuck to me from the moment we arrived. Drink plenty of water. You can pay with credit/debit card at the bigger outlets and restaurants. I had downloaded Alipay but it only works with an internet connection. There is free Wi-Fi in the park which works nicely. Take a power bank! There are ones you can borrow for free in the park that you pay a refundable deposit for through Alipay or similar, however, you have to attach a phone number and it wouldnâ€™t work for us. It appeared you needed a Chinese mobile number. The cast members donâ€™t speak a lot of English but will use a translate app and are very willing to help you. Yeh toilets are very clean with plenty of western style toilets and loo roll (not a given as standard in China). Itâ€™s definitely worth a visit, we loved it. My only complaint, there werenâ€™t any Christmas decorations for sale due to it not being Christmas.",4.0,"This UK couple had a positive experience with their visit to Shanghai Disneyland while on a trip to China. They used the official app to book tickets and fast passes, though they found it to be slow. They had to wait until they were physically in China to buy tickets due to scheduling restrictions. They also purchased a one-day PhotoPass, which allowed them to document their experiences in the park. Despite language barriers, they found the staff and services accommodating. They enjoyed the attractions and were impressed with the cleanliness of the park as well as the availability of western style food. Their only complaint was the lack of Christmas decorations for purchase due to it not being the holiday season. Despite minor difficulties with app speeds and ride commentaries not being in English, they found"
"The worst theme park is Disneyland. I cannot express my negative feelings. Firstly, you walk about 2 kilometers from the taxi collection point to the theme park gate. Secondly, it was very crowded. Thirdly, it was extremely hot and humid. Fourthly, filming with the characters was crowded for about an hour. Fifthly, there is no organization or map in English regarding show times. Sixth, all the rides were crowded. Seventh, the services. Disney ice cream or sweets taste very bad, not delicious, like Disney Orlando, Disney Hong Kong, or Disney Japan. Eighth, I did not encounter any employee at Shanghai Disney, whether in the hallways or at the rides, who spoke English, German, or Spanish. For me it was a waste of time and money",1.0,"The reviewer had a highly negative experience at Disneyland, citing several issues. They found the distance from the taxi point to the park gate excessive and noted that the park was crowded and uncomfortably hot and humid. Wait times to interact with characters were long and the reviewer criticized a lack of English resources for show times and busyness of the rides. The reviewer was also disappointed with the quality of food, specifically ice cream and sweets, and the lack of multilingual staff. They concluded that their visit was a waste of time and money."
"We decided to go for visiting Shanghai Disney in order to celebrate the 50th birthday of one of the participants - the main challenge in the theme park are the long waiting queues - on the Monday we visited (one day ahead of local Summer vacation over), waiting lanes were 2-3 hours for the main attractions - this is obviously is too much for the price you are paying for entrance fees. Therefore value for money is difficult to be judged in a proper way. You can take tons of nice photos and also enjoy the park - however, at one point of time people get tired from waiting and / or walking - restaurants in the park are expensive and not really tasty but fit the purpose - all in all nice place but far away from downtown and other attractions in Shanghai.",4.0,"The review says that the user visited Shanghai Disney for a special occasion but found the long waiting times (2-3 hours) for main attractions very challenging, affecting the perceived value for the money paid for entrance fees. They appreciated the opportunity to take many photos and enjoy the park scenery, but mentioned that the long waits and extensive walking can be tiring. The user also mentioned that while the park-themed restaurants are useful for serving guests, they felt they were not outstanding in terms of cost and taste. Furthermore, the park's distance from Shanghai's downtown and other attractions was seen as a drawback."
"The most beautiful, clean and amazing Disneyland I have ever visited! I have visited every Disneyland in the world and so glad I saved this for last!",5.0,"The review praises this Disneyland park as the most beautiful, clean, and outstanding one the reviewer has ever visited. The reviewer, who has visited every Disneyland across the globe, expressed immense satisfaction, expressing particular happiness about choosing this one as their final visit."
"Any day you will find immensely large crowds but using the app you can pay for the priority queue. In our case for some rides this reduced lines of 2hrs down to 20 mins. Cost is the equivalent of 20 euro per person per ride. Pricey but not worth the wait otherwise (in my view) In the evening, especially during dinner time, the queues get a bit less lengthy which is good. Food is also decent, nothing like the street food crap you would get in EU or US disneyland. Kids loved it. Seems the girls really dress up for this (be prepared for a gazillion princesses) So convenient to be able to get here by metro instead of a long arduous drive. If you want to go shopping there is a disney world shop just outside the park gates which is open one hour longer beyond park closing time.",5.0,"The reviewer suggests the park can be very crowded, but suggests using the app to pay for priority queues which can significantly reduce wait times for rides, albeit at a high cost. The reviewer notes that the queues are shorter during dinner time. They found the food in the park decent, and notably better than what they've experienced at EU or US Disneyland. The park was a hit with their children, particularly the girls who enjoyed dressing like princesses. The reviewer appreciates the convenience of accessing the park by metro, and mentioned a Disney shop located outside the park gates, which is open even after the park closes."
"This is Disneyland, I have been here twice by subway. It is also good to drive, a big parking zone.I suggest you spend a full day here and watch the firework at night.You will never forget this.",5.0,The reviewer had a positive experience visiting Disneyland twice by subway and also recommends driving due to the ample parking available. They suggest spending an entire day at the park and highlight the nighttime fireworks as a memorable feature.
"There are many rides, good atmosphere, cool weather and delicious food.  Just some fun toys  There are princesses and princes who dress up beautifully and handsomely.",5.0,"The review is positive, praising the multiple rides, great atmosphere, pleasant weather, and tasty food at the location. The presence of characters dressed convincingly as princesses and princes was also appreciated."
"I donâ€™t want the public to see the world they live in while theyâ€™re in the park. I want them to feel theyâ€™re in another world â€”Â Walt DisneyChildhood memories captured beautifully. The euphoria from the costumes, songs will magically  transport you to yesteryear.The castle looks magical, the tour was amazing. I loved the parade. The singing was a bit off, but bearable.The food court was packed, the food was okay.Caution, never go during holidays. Went during National holidays. We thought it's a ""rainy"" day, it will not be packed. It cleared up and we got through the lines quicker with passports. But there were long lines everywhere - for rides, food, bathrooms.It was nice seeing kids with the Minnie Mouse ear headbands,  balloons, decor etc.",3.0,"The reviewer expresses a nostalgic appreciation for the experience at the park, noting how the costumes and songs transported them back to their childhood. They found the castle tour and parade impressive, despite some off-key singing. However, they found the food court to be crowded and the food only satisfactory. The reviewer advises against visiting during holidays due to long lines for rides, food, and bathrooms. Despite the crowds, they enjoyed seeing kids with Minnie Mouse headbands and the overall decor."
"Best Disneyland I have been to! (So farâ€¦) I have Been to a variety of Disneylandâ€™s, Paris and a few others, but I would have to Say this was the best one Iâ€™ve been to! It is truly magical and deserves five stars.",5.0,"The user rates this Disneyland as the best they've experienced compared to others, including Paris. They describe it as truly magical and believe it deserves a five-star rating."
"After experiencing Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney Shanghai is a big disappointment.  There don't seem to be any rides and all of the rides they do have, you need to line up for hours just to ride.  We got there and got through the gates just after 10am and left at 8pm and were able to go on only 4 rides!  The parade was very short, with only a couple of floats.  The food up near Iron had a vegan burger which I thought was good.  It has the feel of Disney yet something seems to be missing.",3.0,"The reviewer expressed disappointment with Disney Shanghai after visiting Disney World and Disneyland. They found the park lacking in rides and criticized the long wait times. They spent approximately 10 hours in the park but could only go on four rides. They also found the parade short with only a few floats. On the positive side, they appreciated the food, highlighting a good vegan burger near Iron. They felt the park had a Disney atmosphere but something seemed to be missing."
A pretty magical place.Rides were amazing and the experience smooth and easy even with small kids in tow. Recommend two days and hotel stay to get the most value. Early entry and fast pass invaluable.Dining experience in the park was poor; best eat in the village outside the gates.Fireworks show on Xmas day was an unforgettable experience. Upon leaving my thoughts turns to when I’ll come back…,5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful experience, describing the place as 'magical' with amazing rides and an easy, smooth experience despite having small kids. They recommend a two-day visit and staying in the hotel for maximum value, emphasizing the importance of the early entry and fast pass. They were disappointed with the dining experience inside the park, recommending to eat in the village outside the park instead. They found the fireworks show on Christmas day unforgettable and express a desire to return."
Lovely visit. Not many exciting rides but nice to walk around. Food is not that good as it is of food court style. Better to dine at Disneytown. Mickey’s Parade was fun. Fireworks display at night was fantastic.,4.0,"The reviewer had an enjoyable visit, although they noted a lack of exciting rides. They didn't particularly enjoy the food court-style meals and suggested dining at Disneytown instead. However, they thoroughly enjoyed Mickey's Parade and the nighttime fireworks display."
"What an amazing magical place especially for Christmas . So great and totally worth a visit , good rides, good food in the town just a magical happy place .",5.0,"The review is highly positive, praising this spot as a wonderful, magical place for Christmas. The visitor enjoyed their experience, mentioning that it's worth visiting due to its excellent rides and good food. They ended on a note of happiness, describing the place as joyous and magical."
"It was pretty good. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but I personally prefer the ones in America as the rides are more exciting.",4.0,The reviewer found the experience enjoyable but they believe the rides in America are more exciting.
"Me and my partner had a bad experience at Disneyland. We purchased two nights at the Toy Story Hotel and tickets for the second day. When we arrived, three members of staff all told us that we needed to go to Disney Town the next morning to collect the tickets. So at 07:00 in the morning, we took a bus to Disney Town..But we were told by the staff there that there was no record or proof that we had purchased the tickets and that we needed to get confirmation from the hotel! So this meant, me and my partner, taking the bus BACK to the hotel only for them to give us tickets to get in to the park. What a mess! It really ruined our mood. At first I thought it could have been a misunderstanding, but we are both fluent in Chinese and English, yet they said the same thing in both languages. Lack of experience? I don't know. But it really ruined our experienced as we didn't get into the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded.",1.0,"The reviewer shares a negative experience at Disneyland and the Toy Story Hotel. There was miscommunication on how and where to collect park tickets, causing them to run back and forth between Disney Town and their hotel early in the morning. Despite being fluent in Chinese and English, language did not seem to be the barrier, leading to confusion on whether it was a lack of experience from the staff. The debacle delayed their entry to the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded, which soured their overall experience."
"Visited the park in 2019, pre-Covid and had a blast.The queues weren’t too bad, as we found out we picked quite a good day for our visit and we were able to enjoy almost all of the attractions we were interested in.Even on a not so busy day, some of the attractions were a bit busy and we were thinking that a fast pass would have been a good idea…but then again, the concept of fast passes is a bit of a wallet burning idea.TRON ride is a unique experience that was something else and we really enjoyed Star Wars hall - the 2 meters high Lord Vader was stealing the show.The Pirates of the Caribbean are also a must, as the visual effects are incredible, especially compared to some European parks.Most of us have been to a few amusement parks and this was one of the better ones - however, you should come prepared, as the prices inside are quite high and English translations are not present everywhere.",5.0,"The reviewer had a great time visiting the park in 2019 before Covid-19 hit. They appreciated their timing as the queues weren’t too long, allowing them to enjoy nearly all rides and attractions. The TRON ride and Star Wars hall, featuring a 2 meter high Lord Vader, were special highlights. They also highly recommend the Pirates of the Caribbean for the impressive visual effects. Despite largely positive sentiments, they suggest investing in a fast pass for busier attractions and warn about high prices inside the park. The lack of English translations throughout the park was also mentioned. Overall, they rated it one of the better amusement parks they've been to."
"I am a huge fan of Florida’s Disney World and have been to Disneyland California and Hong Kong. When I moved to China I was very excited to visit this Disneyland the first chance I had. With that said, while the overall experience was fun and had Disney magic, I was a little disappointed. From what I have read the park had changed post-COVID and not for the better.Bottom Line: if you’re a Disney super fan like me and prepared for huge crowds the beauty and uniqueness of this park is worth it. Otherwise the crowds and long lines without free fastpass make this park a challenge!!Details:1) be prepared for HUGE crowds. We went on a weekday and I would hate to see it on a weekend. LONG lines for everything, even bag check + entry turnstiles took about 1.5 hrs (standing in hot direct sun). 2) We arrived 1.5 hours before park opened and got in 5 minutes after opening. The line for some big rides (Soarin) was already almost 3 hours. They do sell early access passes so this might be worth it but I think with crowds from the resorts entering early it would still be very busy.3) Fastpass. This was the biggest and most frustrating change of all. There are NO free fastpass. You can buy fastpass in packages or for single rides but it’s EXPENSIVE- one pass was 180RMB or about $28!! That’s crazy. And with the giant lines…you have to choose either to just wait or pay up. :/4) As for lines- as a frequent visitor of WDW in Florida I was very surprised that early morning lines were actually longer than late morning-early afternoon. Keep an eye on the wait times in the app and try to ride during the afternoon, parades, etc. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Tron had manageable (1 hr or less) lines during the night shows so this is a good option if you’re not watching the night show. As for the night show, plan to stake out a spot around 6:30 for the 8pm show if you want a decent view of the castle.5) The food is not good and is very expensive (more expensive than WDW). Many people have posted that you can’t bring in food; this is not the case in 2021. We packed plenty of snacks but in hindsight I wish we would have packed actual lunch/dinner food. If you do have to eat in the park, Tangled Tree Tavern wasn’t bad. The slightly better and slightly less expensive food is just outside the park in Disneytown- a separate area you can enter/exit throughout the day with your park ticket. The ice cream in Disneytown is very good and will only set you back about $5 instead of the $10 charged in the park.6) The Tron and Pirate rides are amazing!! Even impressed my husband who is not as much of a Disney fanatic. :)7) The park is beautiful and SO BIG! The attention to detail you expect from Disney was amazing.8) We live in China so we were prepared for “Chinese” behavior, which may come as a shock to other visitors. Yes, there is a lot of pushing and crowding. And we did see one little boy peeing on the pavement in front of the castle. Be prepared for pushing and other things you won’t see in America. It’s just China and it’s shocking and gross but you aren’t in America after all! Also the shows and rides are mostly in Mandarin and staff generally speaks little English.also download the Shanghai Disney app and a good VPN (we use ExpressVPN) before you come.As of July 2021 there are very little COVID measures. You have to buy/book your ticket in advance but there’s no social distancing and infrequent mask wearing.",4.0,"The reviewer was generally happy about the Disney magic at Disneyland Shanghai, but expressed dissatisfaction with the post-COVID changes. They noted that crowds are huge and visitors should be prepared for long lines. Fastpasses are now paid services and quite expensive. They found the food pricey and not tasty, but noted that it's permissible to bring your own food. Some notable attractions were the Tron and Pirate rides, and the beauty of the park was outstanding. Still, they cautioned about some culture shock for foreign visitors, as some behaviors common in China might seem strange or impolite to them. The reviewer recommended utilizing the Shanghai Disney app and a VPN, and warned about limited COVID measures in place as of July 2021."
"I booked a 2 day pass on the official website before arrive in Shanghai (around ¥800 weekday 2 day ticket).The subway line 11 arrives straight into the resort! Make sure you buy a return ticket as soon as you arrive! (it will save time when you return)!Day 1: Great day, weather wasn’t the best! It rained which meant that a few rides were suspended until the storm had passed! There is a parade at 12:15pm which is worth watching! Around a 1 hour and less wait for the rides!Day 2: Another great day, although this was a Friday. The park seemed much busier. There were 1/2 hours waits for the rides!There are a mixture of Chinese and western food! The bakery is a much visit!",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience visiting a resort in Shanghai, after pre-booking a 2-day pass for weekdays. Public transportation was convenient, with Subway line 11 leading directly to the location. Day 1 had a bit of rain that caused a few rides to be suspended temporarily, but the wait times were generally short and there was an enjoyable parade. Day 2 was busier, likely due to it being Friday, resulting in slightly longer wait times. The resort offers a mix of Chinese and Western food that appealed to the user, with a particular highlight being the bakery. They recommend purchasing return tickets immediately upon arrival to save time later."
"I don’t understand what is the fuss about with most people who visited Shanghai Disneyland. It’s a theme park and it WILL be crowded from time to time. And this is China. There WILL be people.We visited the park for four consecutive days buying two 2-day tickets each and found this was totally worth it every yuan. The staff at the park are polite, helpful, kind to children and help out however they can. The rides are great! Yes there are queues, and if one plans timings well, like missing the morning parade to do a “Soaring over the Horizon”, or doing TRON during Chinese dinner time, one will find practically no queues. I did buy a fast pass, only because we didn’t want to wait for 60 mins as we wanted to finish Winnie The Pooh ride and go for lunch. It’s a personal choice.If I were only with adults, queues are no big deal, but with little children I preferred a fast pass one day for a chosen ride.Food in the park is good. Limited options for vegetarians like me, but one can always go into Disneytown, eat and come back with the same ticket. It’s allowed! I find that extremely convenient!!!One can never cover everything in the park even after 4 days. It’s really big compared to HK. We loved the park although I wish they should add some specific timings for the English narration of the Pooh ride.We shall return!",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their four-day visit to Shanghai Disneyland and thought it was worth every yuan. They found the park to be crowded as expected, but appreciated the polite and helpful staff. The reviewer praised the rides and shared tips on how to avoid long queues by planning timings well. They liked the option of a fast pass, particularly when visiting with small children. They found the food good, but noted limited vegetarian options. Yet, they appreciated the ability to leave and re-enter the park with the same ticket to access Disneytown. The reviewer wished for English narration during the Pooh ride and looks forward to returning as they couldn't cover the whole park in their visit."
"To enter the park you need to walk from the car park, queue up for the security check, and pass the ticket office, this is a long walk, and took 90 mins. As you must reserve your ticket at least 1day in advance, remember to bring your ID with you ( photo of your passport is fine. The park is massive, today involved a lot of walking and queueing. The top attraction waiting time was constantly three hours so we missed it out but with Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron there was plenty to do.Left tired but happy twelve hours later",4.0,"The reviewer noted that it takes quite a bit of time (90 minutes) to walk from the car park, through security check, and past the ticket office to enter the park, strongly recommending reserving tickets at least a day in advance and having a photo ID. They found the park to be huge, leading to plenty of walking and queuing. Although the wait times for top attractions could be as long as three hours, there were other enjoyable alternatives like Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron. After spending about 12 hours there, they left feeling both exhausted and happy."
"ADVICES to save time and nerves:GET Disnay APP in advance . Be VERY VERY early. BUy transparent water-resistant neck purse for the phone to make videos of your rides. BRING your food with you. IT will save you time.BAD app system. Presumably, you can book a ""stand by pass"" (which used to be free fast pass )  in the official Disney app, once you have a real paper ticket on hands and link it. BUT....its gets fully booked in the first 10 mins after the first people get in and nothing was available after that. WELL DONE, Disnay!  it was a very frustrating part!  PLEASE go back to manual stands inside the park where people used to book 1 free pass for every 2 hours!!!!!! it Was FAIR to everyone!You can buy a fast pass package for single or multiple rides on app. We took most expensive 800 rmb (additionally to 400 rmb ticket)  per person. So tot 1300 gives you access to fast pass of pre-selected by Disney 6 rides (we did 7 or 8 in total from 8:40 till 15:00) . It was a nice experience.The service was good (we exchanged 1 atraction, as there were technical issues with  1 ride on the list. so we changed it, )l personnel was very helpful and well trained.I gave 3 stars because of the system glitch (was on and off during the day) and the MAIN point because we haven't got a single stand-by pass. This  SYSTEM doesn't really work !",3.0,"The reviewer advises downloading the Disney App in advance and arriving very early. They suggest buying a water-resistant purse for recording ride experiences and bringing your own food for convenience. They express frustration with the new ""stand by pass"" system in the Disney App as it gets fully booked within minutes. The reviewer misses the previous system of manual stands in the park where people could book a free pass every two hours. Despite purchasing a costly fast pass package for pre-selected rides, the reviewer was disappointed with the system's glitches and lack of access to the stand-by pass, hence their overall rating of 3 stars. They did, however, praise the service, as the staff allowed an exchange when a ride experienced technical issues. The reviewer found the personnel to be helpful"
"If you want to spend the day spending lots of money and then lining up then this is your place!  We tried to go on a day that might not have the crowds. That was ambitious. I don't think there is every a day like that. It seemed like there aren't a lot of great rides but we did love Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan and Woody's Roundup. We certainly got our step count up as you wander all over all day to try to get to the places with the least line up time. The Disney app is great for letting you know the line times. Food in park is pretty poor as is available seating in restaurants...or lack of.  I'd say this was an ""okay"" Disneyland. People pushing a lot and say good bye to social distancing especially when lining up for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The personal space thing is something to navigate here.  Kids peeing through the fence in the line-ups (parents were there) wasn't a good thing.",3.0,"The reviewer describes their visit to Disneyland as okay but with several drawbacks. They mention it is always crowded, even on days when one might expect fewer people. A limited number of rides were enjoyed, such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan, and Woody's Roundup. The reviewer praises the Disney app for showing line times. However, they were unimpressed with the quality of food and restaurant seating in the park. They also mention a lack of respect for personal space in queues and unsanitary behaviors from some patrons, including kids peeing in line-ups. Despite this, they acknowledged that the park contributed to their step count due to the amount of walking involved."
"We have moved back to China, now living in Shanghai after many years in the north.Went to Disneyland with the kids (8 and 6 years old) a well as my wife’s sister and dad.While we are quite experienced to crowds, Disneyland goes the little extra yard to ensure the full experience of waiting in lines, being pushed, wasting time and at the same time feeling that the whole thing is setup with only one purpose, namely, to get the last RMB out of your pockets before you leave.It was to be honest not a very pleasant trip and while my wife and I fast agreed that now we have visited this place once and sworn never to come back, it was more surprising that the kids during the day also started to complain. My wiffe’s dad? He left at 6:30 pm as he could not stand it anymore (old grumpy man! :-))The good•	Overall clean and nice environment•	Some parts of the park were not too overcrowded (comparing to Chinese standards) so walking around between the different worlds was manageable.•	While we did not try very many rides due to waiting in-line, the TRON Lightcycle Power Run was fun (if you can absorb the 50 min wait and further 20 min wait due to a break down)•	The fireworks/light show was impressive (if you can absorb the wait time and the pushing and shoving)•	Easy to get to, Shanghai Subway runs to the door.The bad•	Pricing. It is obviously not cheap. Please note that the price anchor in China for such things are set high so you will have to pay, which we expected, but again Disneyland just goes that little extra yard to ensure your pockets are completely swiped when you are gone. Entrance price, while not dirt cheap was not really excessive (we paid RMBB 499/adults, 399/children which is ok), however they go to great length to ensure you end up paying extras.•	Food, you must buy food and drinks inside. They have a security check before ticket purchase with the aim to swipe foods from those who brings it (we did not). It adds an extra 30-40 minutes wait-in-line to the experience and we saw quite a few that god food confiscated…my bad feelings started just there. Inside prices are excessive, particular when comparing to standard Chinese prices which on food are low. I will not do a full price list of horrors here, but let me put it this way – I originate from Scandinavia which is by most people (and by facts) considered expensive. In Disneyland their corndog/hotdog on stick like thing was priced with a +100% premium of what a hotdog runs me back in Denmark…so be warned!•	Stores and restaurants are all over and take up a considerably part of the part, in fact in hindsight there are actually only a few attractions given the size of the complex and not lest given the number of visitors they admit in.•	Which leads me the next profit maximizing item, the “jump the line pass”. Having assured that all fun rides are cramped, Disneyland has studied the book “The confessions of the Pricing man” on how to ripe the benefits of this in setting prices that allows you to skip the lines they created. After we arrived and discovered the waiting times for the rides we briefly considered buying one of the skip-the-line passes, but they ran at RMB 1,000 per person (2x adult entrance fee, 2½x children entrance fee) and could maximum be used 8 times! (that is an extra RMB 125 per ride). To be fair they had a whole price range for various skip-the-line passes with allowance for fewer rides, but the price per ride of these were same (actually slightly higher). You come to the suspicion (extremely fast) that it is all a well/evil planned profit maximizing scheme.The uglyWhile everyone that lives in, have lived in or just have been to China knows, crowds are plenty and all over, and this is an integrated part of live, planning and society setup.So having large crowds in Disneyland was be no means any surprise.However, it seemed to have surprised the planners as the number of attractions and particularly the capacity of these by no means matched the number of people let into the park at once.We arrived when the park opened, admittedly go were not in until at least 50 minutes after due to the food swiping exercise at the entrance, but on the advice of my wife’s sister we headed straight to the Soaring over the Horizon ride only to discover that the waiting time was….3 hours! (to be honest I though they were playing me a joke, but no).They had a standby pass system on the app which allows to the reserve time for waiting later…it does not allow you to arrive at a certain time and then avoid waiting. But that system suffered under crowd pressure as well. I managed to make one booking (for myself) but once I tried to add my wife, children, wife’s sister no more time slots were available…and that was that! (not even mentioning since we were six incl. my wife’s dad and the system only allowed groups up to five it was a bit useless for us)After the initially frustrations we then decided to get the best out of the day and try as many rides as we could. We tried the Roaring Rapids (60 mins wait), the Dwarfs mining Train (45 min wait), Rex Riders (90 min wait), TRON power race (50 mins wait + 20 mins break down wait) and the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle (45 min wait) plus my children tried the Dumpo ride, the shipwreck, saw a couple of the characters standing within fenced areas and the youngest also went to the sign along with Elsa/Frozen while the oldest was doing the TRON race.Particularly the Rex Riders was a complete joke. It had a capacity of 20! Low and behold! I guess the person coming up with that idea have never been to China before, at least he did not coordinated with the guy planning for how many to let in on any given day.We also decided to see the 8pm fireworks/lightshow and was advised to be there no later than 7pm if the children should have a chance to see it. We ended up waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for the experience and as time passed more and more people showed up ending in constant pushing, shoving and being in constant physical contract with at least the nearest 3-4 people around you (Ironically the recorded announcer was every 15 minutes welcoming people to the event and telling them to keep social distancing and not blocking other people view…yeah right, maybe if you let 10,000 less people in it would be possible). The had reserved areas which had no people but these were for the people selling snacks, obviously!The really scaring part of the visit came when the show ended as the masses then started to leave. We we quickly decided to carry both children on held each other’s cloth not to lose each other in the black sea of people. It was insane (even for Chinese standards) one step in the wrong direction and we would not have found each other again. So flowing with the masses we (luckily) had to go the exit and the metro station because that was where the masses few to.To think this is a place for children!We came to the place around 8:40 am and left around 8:30pm. A full 12 hours, I tried 4 rides, my children maybe 6 maybe 7, we ate once while sitting, we ate a bit while walking, we saw the parade and besides walking from place to place we spent the rest of the time waiting in line.So be warned, it is a multi-billion dollar brand and by this alone they will attract enough visitors but the experience was noting close to magic, unless it is magic to wait in endless lines and get pushed and shoved.I ranked it, very generously, two starts, due to the parts mentioned under “the good”, but price and value experience does simply not match up. As a benchmark we in the summer had visited both Tivoli Gardens and Bakken amusement parks in Copenhagen, which are both high recommendable. Here the children tried rides all the time (at Bakken my oldest and I managed to run out of rides on the old wooden roller coaster on our access pass, which meant 10 rides on that ride alone). All within the same time spend and at total price that was half to a third of what we spent at Disneyland and with a much cozier atmosphere.The final curiosum is that Walt Disney actually build his Disneyland based on the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen after he had visited the park back in the 50s. His successors have failed miserably with that task in Shanghai.",2.0,"The reviewer found their trip to Disneyland Shanghai overall to be quite disappointing and does not intend to return. They felt that the park was overpriced, overly crowded, and had a focus on making profit rather than ensuring visitor satisfaction. Some positives were that the park was clean and the TRON Lightcycle Power Run and fireworks/light show were enjoyable, but the reviewer was put off by long waiting lines and high prices for extras like food and skipping lines. They were also frustrated with the park's poorly designed app for reserving ride times, crowd management, and lack of ride capacities. In comparison, they found their visits to Tivoli Gardens and Bakken amusement parks in Copenhagen to be much more enjoyable and cost-effective. Despite some positive elements, the"
"Not much to say that hasn't already been said here, but if you're considering going around this time, definitely do it! We visited on January 6th (a Wednesday) and did not need to wait for a single ride! There are quite a few shows to watch throughout the day and quite a few good rides for adults. You can't miss TRON!If you aren't sure whether you'd like to visit or not, you can download the app now to monitor the wait times around the time you plan to visit.From our experience keeping an eye on the waiting times in the app before our trip:If you go during a more busy time of the year, I recommend getting there before the park opens and running straight to Soaring over the Horizon first as it seems to always have the longest wait time. The lines seemed to dwindle down at the very end of the day (after 6:30 pm), as well, if you can save your energy until then.",5.0,"This review strongly recommends visiting the amusement park on a less busy date, with the reviewer's trip on January 6th resulting in no wait times. The park offers numerous shows and adult-friendly rides, with TRON being a highlight. The reviewer suggests using the park's app to monitor wait times to avoid crowds. If visiting during peak times, getting there early and heading to the popular Soaring over the Horizon ride first is recommended. Additionally, lines significantly decrease after 6:30 pm."
"I have been there once before and wanted to take my husband there. I wanted to try out the subway. The subway was easy and fast. Not too hard to find the right gate to get out. Signs were not the best but one can ask and figure it out.My disappointment was at the check point of the park, three "" Happy Host""s were not knowledgeable and unfriendly, they were not happy and not helpful and had no clue how to help, very disappointed for a fun place like this.They did not direct us to the right direction, they simply disappeared. We went around to look for the right gate to enter for a while.  They re rounted ppl due to Covid and did not bother to direct the guests.Same experice with the ticket counter lady, the gate employees, no one was happy, no professional smile,  not to mention being cheerful. sad to see.  And not helpful. They are just not happy to see the guests.The cleaning lady at the Treasure was helpful thoguh, I appreciate that.I had fun dispite this, because the Covid, less ppl at the park, less wait, much faster for the lines.Ate at the Cheesecake Factry, that was nice and noted the ppl also are not very friendly.",2.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience visiting this location. They found the subway system easy to use despite unclear signage. However, they were disappointed with the staff at the park, including the 'Happy Hosts', ticket counter, and gate employees due to their lack of knowledge, unfriendliness, and unwillingness to assist. In contrast, the cleaning staff was found to be helpful. Despite these issues, the reviewer still enjoyed the visit, particularly appreciating the shorter lines due to Covid. Their dining experience at Cheesecake Factory was pleasant, although the service was noted to be unfriendly."
"Good place to visit especially for couples and families. Various different activities compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and Los Angeles Disneyland.  A fun place to be  to spend the whole day. The place is very far from the city so it's better to go early.  A very important advise is to choose a weekday and a day where not many people would show up or else you would wait for hours just to enjoy 1 ride.  Comfortable clothes and shoes are important as the place is huge.  Don't carry any glassware,  food as they will ask you to store it in their locker.  Well compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and the one in Los Angeles the customer service is not great.  Staff don't smile and looks very serious whereas in other Disneyland properties all the Disney staff are smiling and dancing.",4.0,"The reviewer recommends the theme park for couples and families due to its variety of activities that differentiate it from Hong Kong Disneyland and Los Angeles Disneyland. However, it's advised to visit early due to the distance from the city. The reviewer suggests choosing a weekday and less crowded day to avoid long queues for rides. Comfortable clothing and shoes are recommended due to the extent of the park. The reviewer also mentions that glassware or food isn't allowed and should be stored in lockers. The customer service was rated lower compared to other Disneylands, with staff appearing serious rather than friendly and jovial like at other locations."

"What an amazing experience. While visiting the park, we stayed at Toy Story Hotel who were great in giving us advice on how the park operates as far as early entry, fast pass, and so on. We spent some time the day before visiting the park looking around Downtown Disney, and getting a bit of a lay of the land, which helped us over the following days. On our first day in the park, the weather turned bad, as unbeknownst to us there was a typhoon on the way. This meant the large crowds all rushed to spots for protection, which became frustrating. The bad weather forced the closure of many of the rides. The park emptied out, which meant lines that were normally an hour wait were 10 minutes or less, so we pushed on through and took the weather as part of our Disney experience.Within the park there was always a cast member no too far away to help out, and all had a good understanding of English.Due to the typhoon that hit Shanghai, the park was closed for the day that was to be our second day at the park, but the staff transferred all of our fast passes  and entry, and we had no obstacles getting into the park and enjoying it again the following day which was a hidden blessing as the crowds had dwindled down quite a bit. Too many individual highlights to list, but Soaring Over the Horizon, Pirates Of The Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train were right up there.  I would definitely visit again if i was able to, and would recommend it to anyone, of any age",5.0,"The user had a great experience visiting the park and staying at the Toy Story Hotel. They found the advice given by the hotel staff about the park's operational details like early entry and fast pass very useful. They initially had to deal with crowds due to unexpected bad weather caused by an approaching typhoon, which resulted in ride closings. However, this also led to shorter lines. Park staff were always available and helpful, speaking good English. Unfortunately, the park closed due to the typhoon on their second day but the tickets and fast passes were easily transferred. The user found the less crowded park after the typhoon to be a blessing in disguise. The user highlighted some favorite attractions and strongly recommended the place to all age groups."

"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters. Mickey and Goofy discover a magic book, encountering Olaf, Baloo, King Louie, Moana, Mulan, and others along the way, with live music mainly in Chinese and some English songs.Golden Fairytale FanfareAn outdoor show in front of the Enchanted Storybook Castle featuring Snow White, Elsa, Anna, Jasmine, Aladdin, Ariel, Merida, and more, with English songs.Mickey’s Storybook ExpressA 14-minute character parade with numerous Disney favorites.ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime CelebrationA projection mapping show at the Enchanted Storybook Castle with fireworks, fountains, lasers, and Disney and Marvel characters.DiningMickey & Pals Market Café•	Ma La Tang Noodle Soup with Prawn and Beef (¥119) + Dumplings (¥30) - Spicy, tongue-tingling soup with beef slices and shrimp.•	Roasted Spring Chicken with Vegetables (¥129) - Sweet, roasted chicken with a tomato-edamame side.Barbossa’s Bounty•	Barbossa Feast for 2 (¥299) - Grilled squid, ribs, and chicken with two servings of rice; overall, it has a sweet flavor.Zootopia Market•	Disney Zootopia Pawpsicle (¥45) - A sweet and tangy fruit popsicle, perfect for a warm day.RidesPirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken TreasureA boat ride through scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean, with forward, backward, and rotating movements. The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening. Note: photos must be downloaded within 90 days, or they’re deleted automatically.Overall, my day at Shanghai Disneyland was filled with memorable shows, tasty food, thrilling rides, and unique photo ops.",5.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland, highlighting the preparation process, shows, dining options, rides, and the personalized photo session.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, saying it was the best they've visited worldwide.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer was extremely disappointed with their experience at Disneyland in Shanghai, despite being a huge Disney fan. They paid around $1200 for the dream day package for fast passes, but found the staff to be rude and other visitors cutting in lines.

They found the lines in the stores longer than those at the US Disney theme parks and the fast pass system confusing. The reviewer also observed that most of the rides were aimed at children, even though there were barely any kids present. They ended their review by advising others to visit the Great Wall instead and stated that they will not be returning to Shanghai Disneyland."
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget.

The reviewer also emphasizes the unforgettable experience it offers. However, they mention that merchandise is somewhat costly due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful day at Shanghai Disneyland with their family.

They advise downloading the park's app for its helpful features such as ride wait times and navigation. It's also necessary to bring your passport for ticket purchases. They recommend bringing your own water bottles and dry clothes, the latter due to potentially wet rides. Favorite attractions included the Tron roller coaster, the new Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the laser light show with fireworks. They recommend planning ahead and attending on quieter days. The park is considered a highly recommended destination for families."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland during China's summer school holidays and enjoyed the park, particularly the Zootopia land which opened in 2023. They praised the portrayal of the various zones in both the land and the immersive rides. Unique to this park compared to other Disneyland are the Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle rides, and a cooler Pirates of the Caribbean with newer technology. The reviewer found Pooh's ride underwhelming compared to others. The reviewer recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) for visitors flying from afar to save time on queues and also pointed out that this comes with some conditions, including needing a phone for scanning. They did not recommend booking two shows back-to-back though."
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit to this Disney park, noting reasonable ticket prices and short queues during a less crowded period. They especially enjoyed the Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean rides, as well as the new Zootopia area. Frequent parades featuring popular characters were a hit, but the food was deemed average and overpriced. The Marvel section's fireworks were highly praised and worth seeing."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience despite the crowd limiting them to 2-3 rides. The staff provided excellent service, distributing cute stickers to the guests. The snacks on offer were tasty but deemed expensive and in small portions. The food at the restaurant was underwhelming and costly. Unfortunately, due to the high visitor volume, the reviewer was unable to access Zootopia."
"Get there by metro to save money on transport . In fact the taxi might take longer coz there are jams all the time. The Fastpass is really great especially since it doesnâ€™t cost extra and itâ€™s a fair system. Tron and Pirates are by far the best rides. If you are looking for food, those inside the park are standard fare but there are nicer options in Disney town (Xin Wang)",5.0,"The reviewer suggests using the metro rather than a taxi to reach due to frequent traffic jams. They highly recommend the Fastpass system for rides, particularly enjoying Tron and Pirates. While the food inside the park is standard, they recommend trying better options in Disney town, particularly Xin Wang."
"Much better than Hong Kong Disneyland, much bigger. The best is the Tron ride. It was very exciting as I sat in a motorcycle riding position that brought my body and face forward, quite scary. Overall it was a good time with the kids. The light show in the evening was also nice. Then we had a nice dinner in the Cheesecake Factory!",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience, finding it superior to Hong Kong Disneyland due to its larger size. The Tron ride was a highlight, offering an exciting and slightly scary motorcycle riding simulation. The reviewer also enjoyed time with the kids, an evening light show, and a pleasing dinner at the Cheesecake Factory."
"We visited Disneyland during winter. Itâ€™s not so crowded in which you can entered all rides if you plan well. For the night show, we have waited to see the show and firework at 8pm, unfortunately, there is no firework on that night due to bad air pollution but understandable reason though. So if you would like to see the firework, maybe you need to take air pollution as consideration before as well.",4.0,"The review describes a satisfactory visit to Disneyland during winter, when it was not very crowded and allowed them to enjoy all the rides with proper planning. However, they were disappointed as they couldn't see the fireworks during the night show at 8pm due to air pollution. They suggest that others planning to watch the fireworks should consider the likely air quality."
"If you like Disney you will not be disappointed. This park is pretty awesome with lots of great attractions and, of course, the largest castle. The Enchanted Storybook Castle is huge and looms over 197 feet tall over the park. Everything in China is busy and Disney is no exception so come prepared and get fast pass.",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends the park for Disney fans as it boasts numerous attractive features, including the tremendously large Enchanted Storybook Castle. However, they also note that, similar to its surroundings in China, the park can get very busy, hence they suggest coming prepared and obtaining a fast pass."
"OK here are few tips ya so listen up-go early ..otherwise long queue to enter , i was there 7.30am on a Thursday and not a school holiday and it is still packed at the entrance- you can bring food and drinks into the park ..this is the BEST thing ever, i brought drinks, cakes , biscuits , water and sandwiches ... so while you queue for the ride you can eat some thing , plenty of bins to dispose your garbage- make sure you download the Shanghai disney APP for  fastpass- use your fastpass on rides wile 7 darwfs, soaring Horizon, Tron etc-when you first enter Disney ..quickly go to the Castle for the opening ceremony ..its beautiful-try to get takeaway food for dinner , and go to the Castle starting 6.30pm ... for the closing ceremony and fire works- if you have kids, i dont think you can cover the park in one day- since you will most probably take photo , video and using disney Fast pass ... your smart phone is crucial ..do bring a powerbank-if money is not an issue, and you have very young kids , use the app and pay a bit more for early entry ..this save you from the running and crowdhave fun , this is one of the best Disneyland ever",5.0,"The reviewer suggests arriving early to Shanghai Disney due to long entrance queues. You can bring your own food and drink into the park, which they found to be a major plus. They recommend downloading the Shanghai Disney app for fast pass access to rides like 7 Dwarfs, Soaring Horizon, and Tron. They highlight the opening ceremony at the castle as a must-see. For dinner, takeaway food is suggested, and they recommend returning to the castle for the closing ceremony and fireworks around 6.30pm. They emphasize that covering the entire park in one day is difficult, especially with kids. Power banks are recommended to keep mobile devices charged for photos, videos and the Disney Fast Pass feature. For those who can afford it, the"
stunning place to enjoy especially if the weather is good so much to do and check the Soar show is amazing,5.0,"The reviewer praises the location as being particularly enjoyable in good weather, offering many activities. They specifically recommend the Soar show as an amazing experience."
"Definitely a must visit when youâ€™re in Shanghai!! Worth every penny. The attractions never fail to amaze me and almost all the rides come with an amazing and magical experiences. I am definitely in awe and would highly recommend this place! Do also stay till 8pm to watch the fireworks which comes with a live 3D experience of Disney characters outside the iconic castle. However, please avoid coming on a weekend as it can get overly crowded.",5.0,"The user highly recommends the visit to this attraction in Shanghai, stating that it's worth the cost. The user enjoyed the amazing and magical experiences offered by the rides. They also suggested watching the 3D fireworks show featuring Disney characters at 8pm outside the iconic castle. They noted, though, that weekends can be overly crowded, so it's better to visit on a weekday."
"We have always like theme parks. This park is big. We stayed at Disneyland hotel and had early access, which is great because we manage to go on a few rides without queue and also manage to book fastpasses without much effort (although we did need to figure out how to book for a while but the app is friendly enough, just that wifi connection in china is a pain).My older child enjoyed herself very much. My younger one (3yo) tired easily, so it is a good thing we can pop back and forth the hotel.Great firework at the end.",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit to the theme park, particularly benefiting from staying at the Disneyland hotel, which allowed for early access and easier booking of fastpasses. The park's size and the ease of use of the park's app were also appreciated, although there were issues with the wifi connection in China. Their older child loved the park, while their younger child tired easily; the ability to easily return to the hotel was deemed a positive. The firework display at the end was highly appreciated."
"To all like me, VISIT THIS PLACE and you will to, love the Tron roller coaster! Then, rate an excellent like me!!!",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends visiting this place, especially for the Tron roller coaster, which they loved. They rate the place as excellent."

"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters. Mickey and Goofy discover a magic book, encountering Olaf, Baloo, King Louie, Moana, Mulan, and others along the way, with live music mainly in Chinese and some English songs.Golden Fairytale FanfareAn outdoor show in front of the Enchanted Storybook Castle featuring Snow White, Elsa, Anna, Jasmine, Aladdin, Ariel, Merida, and more, with English songs.Mickey’s Storybook ExpressA 14-minute character parade with numerous Disney favorites.ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime CelebrationA projection mapping show at the Enchanted Storybook Castle with fireworks, fountains, lasers, and Disney and Marvel characters.DiningMickey & Pals Market Café•	Ma La Tang Noodle Soup with Prawn and Beef (¥119) + Dumplings (¥30) - Spicy, tongue-tingling soup with beef slices and shrimp.•	Roasted Spring Chicken with Vegetables (¥129) - Sweet, roasted chicken with a tomato-edamame side.Barbossa’s Bounty•	Barbossa Feast for 2 (¥299) - Grilled squid, ribs, and chicken with two servings of rice; overall, it has a sweet flavor.Zootopia Market•	Disney Zootopia Pawpsicle (¥45) - A sweet and tangy fruit popsicle, perfect for a warm day.RidesPirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken TreasureA boat ride through scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean, with forward, backward, and rotating movements. The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening. Note: photos must be downloaded within 90 days, or they’re deleted automatically.Overall, my day at Shanghai Disneyland was filled with memorable shows, tasty food, thrilling rides, and unique photo ops.",5.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland, highlighting the preparation process, shows, dining options, rides, and the personalized photo session. Before the visit, they downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app to purchase tickets and various passes, including the Personalized Magical Photo Session for which they paid ¥721. The session entailed a private photographer following them around the park for 90 minutes. Other purchasable features through the app included information about dining options, show schedules, and wait times.

Upon arrival, the reviewer noted that security was similar to other Disney parks. They used their passport as their ticket, which was scanned at the entrance. A paper ticket was issued that contained a QR code for reservations. Inside the park, the reviewer confirmed their Personalized Magical Photo Session"
"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, saying it was the best they've visited worldwide. They particularly enjoyed it during the non-peak season in October due to fewer crowds and good weather. The park was praised for being clean, well-maintained, and safe. Its food and souvenirs were cheaper than other Disneyland parks. The reviewer enjoyed the variety of restaurants and cafes, and commented on the friendliness of the staff.

The rides were generally suitable for their young children and waiting times were manageable, 15-20 minutes for most rides, but popular ones took 45-60 minutes. The Disney Primer Access (DPA) was found useful, especially for the special entrance for the nighttime illumination show that they greatly enjoyed. They also"

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer was extremely disappointed with their experience at Disneyland in Shanghai, despite being a huge Disney fan. They paid around $1200 for the dream day package for fast passes, but found the staff to be rude and other visitors cutting in lines. They had an issue with the Tron ride and received an almost useless coupon as an apology. They found the lines in the stores longer than those at the US Disney theme parks and the fast pass system confusing. The reviewer also observed that most of the rides were aimed at children, even though there were barely any kids present. They ended their review by advising others to visit the Great Wall instead and stated that they will not be returning to Shanghai Disneyland."
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The review praises Shanghai Disneyland for offering an outstanding experience due to its various zones, themed rides, and food options. The reviewer also emphasizes the unforgettable experience it offers. However, they mention that merchandise is somewhat costly due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful day at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. However, they suggest purchasing priority passes to avoid long wait times, especially during weekends or public holidays. They advise downloading the park's app for its helpful features such as ride wait times and navigation. It's also necessary to bring your passport for ticket purchases. They recommend bringing your own water bottles and dry clothes, the latter due to potentially wet rides. Favorite attractions included the Tron roller coaster, the new Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the laser light show with fireworks. They recommend planning ahead and attending on quieter days. The park is considered a highly recommended destination for families."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes.

Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets.

Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing.

The reviewer found Pooh's ride underwhelming compared to others.

We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section.

"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot.

I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, saying it was the best they've visited worldwide.

The rides were generally suitable for their young children and waiting times were manageable, 15-20 minutes for most rides, but popular ones took 45-60 minutes.

The reviewer also recommended items to carry such as ID, layers of clothing, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, wipes, hand sanitizers, water bottles, and snacks.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer was extremely disappointed with their experience at Disneyland in Shanghai, despite being a huge Disney fan. They paid around $1200 for the dream day package for fast passes, but found the staff to be rude and other visitors cutting in lines. They had an issue with the Tron ride and received an almost useless coupon as an apology. They found the lines in the stores longer than those at the US Disney theme parks and the fast pass system confusing. The reviewer also observed that most of the rides were aimed at children, even though there were barely any kids present. They ended their review by advising others to visit the Great Wall instead and stated that they will not be returning to Shanghai Disneyland."
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget.

The reviewer also emphasizes the unforgettable experience it offers. However, they mention that merchandise is somewhat costly due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful day at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. However, they suggest purchasing priority passes to avoid long wait times, especially during weekends or public holidays. They advise downloading the park's app for its helpful features such as ride wait times and navigation. It's also necessary to bring your passport for ticket purchases. They recommend bringing your own water bottles and dry clothes, the latter due to potentially wet rides. Favorite attractions included the Tron roller coaster, the new Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the laser light show with fireworks. They recommend planning ahead and attending on quieter days. The park is considered a highly recommended destination for families."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland during China's summer school holidays and enjoyed the park, particularly the Zootopia land which opened in 2023.

With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, saying it was the best they've visited worldwide. They particularly enjoyed it during the non-peak season in October due to fewer crowds and good weather. The park was praised for being clean, well-maintained, and safe. Its food and souvenirs were cheaper than other Disneyland parks. The reviewer enjoyed the variety of restaurants and cafes, and commented on the friendliness of the staff.

The rides were generally suitable for their young children and waiting times were manageable, 15-20 minutes for most rides, but popular ones took 45-60 minutes. The Disney Primer Access (DPA) was found useful, especially for the special entrance for the nighttime illumination show that they greatly enjoyed. They also"

They advised buying tickets in advance and emphasized the importance of ensuring passport numbers matched the one provided at the time of booking; any errors can cause issues but can be sorted out at guest services. They suggested visiting on weekdays when it's less busy and cheaper. The reviewer also recommended items to carry such as ID, layers of clothing, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, wipes, hand sanitizers, water bottles, and snacks. Disney's policy allows customers to wear costumes that do not cover the face. They suggested using the Shanghai Disney App for timely updates and to download a translation app. Reservations for character dining are also recommended.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer was extremely disappointed with their experience at Disneyland in Shanghai, despite being a huge Disney fan. They paid around $1200 for the dream day package for fast passes, but found the staff to be rude and other visitors cutting in lines. They had an issue with the Tron ride and received an almost useless coupon as an apology. They found the lines in the stores longer than those at the US Disney theme parks and the fast pass system confusing. The reviewer also observed that most of the rides were aimed at children, even though there were barely any kids present. They ended their review by advising others to visit the Great Wall instead and stated that they will not be returning to Shanghai Disneyland."
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The review praises Shanghai Disneyland for offering an outstanding experience due to its various zones, themed rides, and food options. The reviewer also emphasizes the unforgettable experience it offers. However, they mention that merchandise is somewhat costly due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful day at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. However, they suggest purchasing priority passes to avoid long wait times, especially during weekends or public holidays. They advise downloading the park's app for its helpful features such as ride wait times and navigation. It's also necessary to bring your passport for ticket purchases. They recommend bringing your own water bottles and dry clothes, the latter due to potentially wet rides. Favorite attractions included the Tron roller coaster, the new Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the laser light show with fireworks. They recommend planning ahead and attending on quieter days. The park is considered a highly recommended destination for families."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland during China's summer school holidays and enjoyed the park, particularly the Zootopia land which opened in 2023. They praised the portrayal of the various zones in both the land and the immersive rides. Unique to this park compared to other Disneyland are the Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle rides, and a cooler Pirates of the Caribbean with newer technology. The reviewer found Pooh's ride underwhelming compared to others. The reviewer recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) for visitors flying from afar to save time on queues and also pointed out that this comes with some conditions, including needing a phone for scanning. They did not recommend booking two shows back-to-back though."
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit to this Disney park, noting reasonable ticket prices and short queues during a less crowded period. They especially enjoyed the Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean rides, as well as the new Zootopia area. Frequent parades featuring popular characters were a hit, but the food was deemed average and overpriced. The Marvel section's fireworks were highly praised and worth seeing."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience despite the crowd limiting them to 2-3 rides. The staff provided excellent service, distributing cute stickers to the guests. The snacks on offer were tasty but deemed expensive and in small portions. The food at the restaurant was underwhelming and costly. Unfortunately, due to the high visitor volume, the reviewer was unable to access Zootopia."
"Quite underwhelmed. My mam and dad wanted to go during their visit to China because they had never been to Disney land. Me and my wife were reluctant as our baby is 1.4 yrs old, and wondered who it would really be for, cause it ainâ€™t for us. They insisted it would be fun and even the baby would love it.I was reluctant but I thought, well itâ€™s supposed to be world class isnâ€™t it. Even if the queues for the rides are preposterously long, they must have sufficient entertainment for even the adults I guess. Wrong. Aside from the morning parade which was legit cool, the rest was just rides and visual things to look at, or super expressive consumerist experiences in the shops. The rides are not even that special or enticing to me, Iâ€™ve been in a few theme parks and even the just ok rides would have you waiting an hour to an hour and a half. Thatâ€™s about a third or a quarter of the time youâ€™d spend out and about, after you omit your meals. Just bad value.I really thought thereâ€™d be magical entertainment all over, like how in the fringe fest in Edinburgh, when you walk around thereâ€™s street acts and an electric vibe. Nothing really here though except walking around at the impressive areas they created. Although those areas are visually impressive, the main thing to do it seems is go to the rides. But the wait makes it impractical and miserable. Unless you wanna go on the equivalent to the teacupsâ€¦ then good for you only 20m wait.People spend a lot of time waiting to queue just for a photo with a character. We waited half an hour just to get the baby in a photo with Mickey Mouse and I just thought this is all just a big charade isnâ€™t it. I mean why not just have a few Mickey Mouseâ€™s and other big characters wondering round the park? Why just have one and make a big deal of this mere photo opportunity, put him in a big special building for this purpose and then make you wait all that time. Why so orchestrated?I thought I might see some tricks and fun things in the streets as I walked around but I didnâ€™t. I think sometimes people pay a lot for things and then become invested so they say things were good cause they donâ€™t wanna admit they wasted money on a bad idea or that the ideas they have for passing time are actually rubbish ðŸ˜‚Finally, I didnâ€™t see anything that was very entertaining for such young babies. Like a baby play area or anything like that. It may be a bit much to expect them to cater in this regard but, who are they catering to currently? I didnâ€™t feel like it was me, and it wasnâ€™t for the babyâ€¦ so just kids? Well it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Put on more entertainment, shows, street tricks, activities",2.0,"The reviewer found their experience at Disneyland China to be underwhelming, especially as they felt it lacked suitable entertainment for adults and young children. While they found the parade enjoyable and the park visually impressive, they found the ride queues excessively long and the overall experience to have bad value. They also found it overly focused on consumerist experiences in the shops and were disappointed by the orchestrated photo opportunities with characters, which were time-consuming. The reviewer suggested enhancing the entertainment, show and activities throughout the park, and felt additional street acts of the sort found at Edinburgh's fringe fest could create an improved, more electric vibe. They also wished there were more play areas or attractions for very young children."
"Rubbish customer service, brought the wrong size at closing time rushing for the last train at night. Went back next day to exchange and was told by a member of staff I had to buy the correct size then go to the refund desk to get a refund. After the queuing up got to told I can't refund it as I had got free gifts when I had originally purchased a lot of items the day before and to get a refund I would have to give them the gifts back. All I wanted was to change the item to correct size. Supervisor came out and started to raise her voice and told me to go find her colleague who told us we could do this. Bare in mind this place is huge. She then shoved the back of the receipt in my face and shouted at us ( we have 3 kids, in Disneyland) saying it's in Chinese and English in her broken English. I had to walk out really frustrated and angry. The lack of customer relations is ridiculous, they are definitely better Disney parks than this one. We weren't trying to con them, al I wanted was the correct size for my son. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1.0,"The reviewer's experience with customer service at this Disney park was extremely unsatisfactory. They purchased the wrong size item and tried to exchange it the next day, but were told they had to purchase the correct size and get a refund after. The refund process was complicated by the fact that they had received free gifts with their original purchase, which they were told they had to return. The supervisor's response was unhelpful, confrontational and the language barrier made the situation worse. The reviewer felt frustrated, angry and believes this park lacks proper customer relations. They strongly recommend against visiting."
"I was super thrilled to see the first time Disneyland. It is really huge  and have variety of attractions. However, waiting for one ride can take from 1-2 hours. All day i had only 6-7 rides, when i could have more than that. Food is also little pricey. However, I enjoyed walking around and to be spectator of wonderful fireworks.",4.0,"The review is mostly positive about Disneyland, praising its size and variety of attractions. The reviewer enjoyed walking around and viewing the fireworks. However, they raised concerns about long wait times for rides, only managing to go on 6-7 throughout the day, and found the food to be a bit pricey."
"overall the experience was good. lets start from the advantages, the staff member was polite, we had a lot of fun there. but it's not recommended with no fast pass, especially the ones who wanna play the popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster (we bought one), if you wanna get to play all rides or at least half of them, a fast pass could help a lot. the average queue time for a ride could take an hour or more. Since we went in Wednesday there's not a lot of people, but sure there might be MASSVE amount of people in the summer break or other holidays.",4.0,"The review is generally positive about the experience, praising the polite staff and enjoyable time. However, the reviewer warns that without a fast pass, wait times for popular rides can be long, sometimes over an hour. They recommend purchasing a fast pass to experience all or most of the rides. The reviewer also noted that they went on a Wednesday when crowds were less, but caution that during holidays and summer break, there could be massive crowds."
We came here straight after Paris Disney which we rated highly. Sadly July is a no to visit this place. It was local school holidays and we went on a Monday. The heat and lack of shade and indoor eating areas did us in. The lines and entrance confusion was a bad start but then the absence of shade in 39 degree heat was a no go. We did two rides and had to leave when we lined up for 40 minutes just to get into a place to eat only to then have to search for a table - after looking for a table for 20 minutes we headed home.,2.0,"The reviewer visited the place after Paris Disney, but was disappointed with their experience. They visited in July, during local school holidays, and found the place to be too crowded and hot, with temperatures reaching 39 degrees. There was a lack of shade and indoor eating areas, and they had to deal with long lines and confusion at the entrance. They only managed to go on two rides and struggled to find a table in the eating area, prompting them to leave early."
"The walk to the entrance if by tour bus is half an hour. Once you get to the gate area, there's so many zigzag barriers that even on a not so busy day, you have to walk round and round on what otherwise would only be a few steps without the barriers.This is the first Disneyland I've been to where you're allowed to bring in food.Rides and queues inside are otherwise orderly.  I only saw 3 people spitting on the ground (I was expecting more).  A few people were smoking outside the designated smoking areas.We spent 2 days here.  This can actually be experienced in a day.",4.0,"The reviewer notes that access to the entrance from the tour bus takes about half an hour due to considerable barriers which create a zigzag path, causing unnecessary walking. This Disneyland allows visitors to bring their own food. Inside, the rides and queues were organized. The reviewer noticed some people breaking rules by spitting on the ground and smoking outside of designated areas. The reviewer spent two days but felt it could be experienced within one day."
A below average Disneyland experience despite excellent hardware. I had fast pass to save time but still felt like I was a semi-finished good in a conveyance belt. My feeling is that 50% of the staffs didnâ€™t make guests feel welcoming and 70% has no smile on their face.Personally I disliked most is smoking. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see people smoking in non-smoking areas and the staffs appeared that they didnâ€™t care. This is extremely disturbing for a non-smoker like myself,3.0,"The user had a subpar experience at Disneyland despite utilizing a fast pass. They felt uncared for, noticing that many staff members did not seem welcoming or happy. They were particularly disturbed by people smoking in non-smoking areas, and were frustrated that the staff seemed indifferent to this issue."
"It was rainy, hot, and humid so I wouldn't recommend going in June. BUT the air conditioning was excellent once you got into buildings. The Zootopia area is incredible and so cute! I also loved the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show. So amazing! This is a wonderful park. Loved it!",5.0,"The reviewer recommends avoiding visiting in June due to humid and rainy weather conditions. However, they praise the excellent air conditioning inside the buildings and appreciate the Zootopia area, considering it incredible and cute. They also highly enjoyed the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show, noting them as amazing. Overall, they found the park wonderful and had a great experience."
Good  but was quite disappointed with the handling of the queues for the shows by the staff and the waiting period was terrible. People were cutting lies trying to go over you and the entertainment shows were hardly 15 minutes. I would give it an average and Please note that seating areas to rest yourself are very limited. During peak hours it's a really killer. Dining was average to but there was a really good pastry shop in mickeys downtown. There were too many characters as well.  Shopping was excellent bur crowd control could be managed better.,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings about the experience, featuring both positive and negative comments. The reviewer was disappointed with the staff's handling of queues for shows and the long waiting period, with some issues regarding people cutting the line. The entertainment shows were seen as too short, only about 15 minutes each. They found the number of available seating areas to be insufficient, especially during peak hours. The dining experience was rated as average, however, they did compliment a particular pastry shop in Mickey's downtown. The reviewer had issues with the numerous characters and thought that crowd management could be improved. However, they were pleased with the shopping experience."
"Get harassed by all the illegal toads right infront of the Disney entrance, inside Disney and upon exit to try sell you all toys, service,etc. Super irritating.The working Crew are a huge turn off during our entry and during the games. Most of the staffs mostly dont live up to Disney name. They are rude and unhelpful. If you speak foreign lauggage here then good luck to you..I keep seing people either fight, quarrel or police came to escort people out from the park. Disaster.... this will be my first and last to visit the Shanghai Disney. Will not recommend anyone here unless you just wanna come here for Instagram than to enjoy a real theme park ride.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience at Shanghai Disney due to aggressive soliciting practices from vendors both outside and inside the park. They found the staff unhelpful and rude, undermining the Disney brand. The reviewer also mentions frequent disturbances such as fights and police escorts. They will not be returning to Shanghai Disney and do not recommend it to others, unless their interest is solely for social media photographs."
"We went on a non holiday week day in June, but the lines are too long. Even to just to get into the park took nearly 40 mins. You can buy speed pass (180 Yuan per person per ride). For a family of 3, you can end up spending a lot of money or wait >1 hour for each ride. Overall I would say it would say it is not worth going. My child had more fun at the Shanghai aquarium.",2.0,"The reviewer visited a park on a non-holiday weekday in June but was disappointed due to extremely long waiting times, even for entry which took almost 40 minutes. They mention the availability of a speed pass, but criticise it for being expensive, especially for a family of three. The reviewer doesn't recommend the park, stating their child had a better experience at the Shanghai aquarium."
"My recent experience at Shanghai Disneyland left me deeply disappointed and frustrated due to several concerning issues that significantly marred what should have been a magical visit.Secondhand Smoke Everywhere: Despite designated smoking zones, the park is overrun with inconsiderate visitors who openly smoke wherever they please, subjecting everyone, especially children, to the dangers of secondhand smoke. This blatant disregard for the rules and lack of courtesy from some Chinese guests made navigating the park a challenge and significantly impacted our enjoyment.Illegal Peddlers: Shockingly, just outside the Disney shops, illegal peddlers openly sell Disney merchandise, directly undermining the integrity of the park's retail experience. It's incomprehensible how Disney allows such activities to persist, tarnishing the authenticity and trust associated with its brand.Annual Pass Holder Abuse: Throughout the park, we encountered aggressive annual pass holders exploiting their privileges to engage in unlawful behavior. These individuals relentlessly pestered guests to purchase Disney merchandise through them, falsely promising discounts and circumventing proper queues. It became evident that they were exploiting their pass holder status to undercut Disney, all in pursuit of personal gain and the advancement of their membership tiers.Overall, my visit to Shanghai Disneyland was marred by these unacceptable issues, detracting from what should have been a magical experience. It's disheartening to witness such blatant disregard for rules and ethics within the confines of a place meant to inspire joy and wonder. I sincerely hope that management takes swift and decisive action to address these issues and uphold the standards of excellence that Disney is known for.",1.0,"The reviewer was disappointed by their experience at Shanghai Disneyland, which was marred by three significant problems: secondhand smoke, illegal peddling, and abuse of privileges by annual pass holders. Despite designated smoking areas, a lot of visitors were smoking all over the park, affecting everyone's enjoyment. The park also had illegal peddlers selling Disney merchandise just outside the official shops, harming the park's retail integrity. Moreover, some annual pass holders were abusing their privileges, pushing guests to purchase Disney merchandise through them at supposed discounts, and bypassing queues. The reviewer hopes urgent action will be taken to rectify these issues."
The park is awesome like all disney parks. But even on a weekday its too tooo tooo crowded. You end up waiting 40 mins for one ride. Try and book fast track if available and just avoid weekends. Access is also easy by metro and car.,4.0,"The reviewer praised the park, comparing it favorably to all Disney parks. However, they found it to be very crowded even on weekdays, causing long waits for rides. They recommend booking a fast track if possible and avoiding weekends. They also noted that the park is easily accessible by both metro and car."
"We visited during a Chinese school holiday, which meant it was very crowded and the queues very long. Food and drink was expensive, For example, Â£6.00 for a pineapple flavoured ice cream cone.A bit of a faff organising admission passes and fast passes and you must take your passport.We quite enjoyed the visit and obviously, being Disney there is plenty to see , to do and it is pleasant to walk around. At nighttime the best viewing areas get extremely crowded, so find a good spot early and hang on to it.",4.0,"The reviewer visited during a Chinese school holiday, resulting in large crowds and long queues. They found the food and drinks to be expensive, with mention of a £6 pineapple ice cream. Arranging admission and fast passes was a bit of a hassle and required a passport. However, they enjoyed the visit due to a wide variety of sights and activities offered by Disney. They warned about crowdie in the best viewing areas at night, suggesting finding a good spot early."
"We had one day at the Park on a free day during part of a 10 day tour of China.  As this was the only DIsney park in the world I hadn't yet been to, I was very keen to visit, and I wasn't disappointed.We ordered our tickets online the night before, and I was able to easily pay with a foreign (non-Chinese) travel card. (A fellow traveller did have a few issues with their card, but they were eventually able to finalise the transaction). The tickets were then linked to our passports, so it is very important to remember to take your passport with you as this is now your entry ticket.We visited on a weekday in mid November, and arrived just before opening time. Entry was quick and easy (including bag inspections).  A lot of the rides were walk-on with minimal wait times during the morning. It became a bit busier in the afternoon, but was still very manageable. (This was the complete opposite of Tokyo Disneyland a few years ago, which was horrendously overcrowded all three days we were there, during the so-called ""off peak"" time. Never again).The Park was beautiful, clean and easy to navigate.  Our ticket included a free meal and drink, which was great value. I chose spaghetti and meatballs, which was huge and filled me up for the day. The menu prices seemed quite reasonable, especially for a Disney park. We bought the PhotoPass, and had some issues trying to get it to work/download, but the staff in the photo shop were amazingly patient and helpful in getting it to finally work.I was disappointed to discover Pirates of the Caribbean was closed, but it's a great excuse to revisit in the future!",5.0,"The reviewer visited the Disney park in China as part of a 10-day tour and had a mostly pleasant experience. They ordered tickets online beforehand with a foreign travel card, which was smoothly processed, and the tickets were linked to their passport. They found the entry process to be quick and easy, and the park was not overly crowded. The park was clean, well-maintained, and easy to navigate. They were pleased that their ticket included a free meal, which they found to be of great value and portion size. They ran into some issues with the PhotoPass, but the problem was swiftly resolved by helpful park staff. The only disappointment was that the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed."
Lots of things to check out no matter which corner we turn to! Enjoyed the concerts and interactive shows immensely (need to understand the Chinese language for a more immersive experience though). Queue was manageable on the day we went.,5.0,"The review praises the variety of attractions, with plenty to see and explore. The reviewer particularly enjoyed the concerts and interactive shows, though noted that understanding Chinese enhances the experience. The reviewer further mentioned that the crowds were manageable on their visit."
"Such a bad experience with staff gate, they did not let us enter due to ticketing reasons. After we waited and argued for more than an hour they just let us enter.?",2.0,The reviewer had a negative experience with the staff at the gate due to issues related to tickets. They were denied entry and had to wait and argue for over an hour before they were allowed in.
"Good:1. Quite a big park with a good variety of rides, performances and F&B outlets; Facilities are good overall.2. F&B doesn't cost an arm and a leg like some other parks.3. Relatively well organised and efficiently run park.Bad:1. Most service staff do not seem motivated to give visitors a good experience, they do not smile and their greetings are monotone; Compared to the other Disney parks in the region, the service level is far behind.2. Security officers behave like thugs, barking at visitors during the night event. I understand the need for crowd control, but I've never seen such unruly behavior even from actual law enforcement officers, much less a bunch of security staff.Conclusion:Great activities and rides only form part of the experience, great service is what truly makes Disneyland a magical experience, Unfortunately this is missing in Shanghai Disneyland.",2.0,"The reviewer appreciates the size of Shanghai Disneyland, its variety of rides, performances, and food and beverage outlets, as well as its overall organization. They valued the food prices not being overly expensive. However, the review highlights major issues with the service, including unmotivated staff and aggressive security officers. The reviewer asserts that while the park has great activities and rides, the missing element of great service prevents it from offering the magical Disneyland experience found elsewhere."
"Believe it or not, the max we had to queue for any ride was 20 minutes. That was because we went on a rainy day, and the day before Zootopia opened so that kept the crowds away somewhat we think. Having gone to Paris, Hong Kong and LA, this was probably the best experience we had - ever - just because the queues for any ride was so short!Food was better at Universal Resorts Beijing, but the overall experience here cannot be beat. My kids' favourite ride was Roaring Rapids and Tron - Soaring Over The Horizon also rated quite highly too!",5.0,"The reviewer had a highly positive experience at the park thanks to short queue times, likely due to visiting on a rainy day and just before a new attraction opened. They compared this visit favorably to trips to Paris, Hong Kong, and LA, praising it as the best due to the short queues. While they found the food better at Universal Resorts Beijing, the overall experience at this park was unbeatable. The reviewer's kids especially enjoyed the Roaring Rapids and Tron rides, with Soaring Over The Horizon also receiving high marks."
"I loved this park, itâ€™s got that Disney charm but just takes the rides up to the next level.Letâ€™s start with the rides: Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron just take the rides up that notch. Pirates in particular is insane about just how immersive it really is, this isnâ€™t the pirates youâ€™re used to but it just blows your mind as youâ€™re going around.The park is stunning and the theming is beautiful throughout and is topped off by the beautiful castle as itâ€™s centre. Having watched vlogs and seen pictures before visiting, I was a little worried I was going to be disappointed and it wouldnâ€™t have a charm as it was so big; I shouldnâ€™t have been worried at all. The castle is perfect and the area around it is different to other Disneyâ€™s which provides great viewing areas for the nightly shows.My only slight negative is, this park is big! It doesnâ€™t have the same charm in some areas as itâ€™s smaller counterparts. For example, Fantasyland is spread out so doesnâ€™t have the same â€˜villageâ€™ type appearance as others.Also, I canâ€™t wait to see what they do with this park in future. Itâ€™s clearly been built with expansion in mind so look forward to seeing how it matures and progresses.",4.0,"The user adores this park, especially for its Disney charm and innovative rides, with Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron highlighted as impressive for their immersive experiences. They commend the stunning aesthetics, especially the beautiful castle and its surroundings, which provide ideal viewing spots for the nightly shows. The user was initially worried about the park's large size and feared it might lack charm, but their visit dispelled these concerns. However, they critique certain areas, like Fantasyland, for lacking the village-like charm of smaller counterparts due to being spread out. The user anticipates future expansion in the park and is excited to see how it evolves."
"This was our second visit, after our first which was in 2016.The place is still as magical as ever!The rides are awesome, if only the queues were not horrendous. Mind you, we went during the national holiday, so it was to be expected. If you don't mind paying for the express lane, and the queue is above 60 minutes, I'd say it is absolutely worth spending your money to shorten the queue and save yourself from the exhaustion of standing in the queue. If you are up for the thrill, I'd strongly suggest Tron ride at the Tomorrowland.We came on the first day of October and were absolutely delighted to see the wonderful Halloween decorations and souvenirs around the park.The cleanliness of the entire place is top notch, including every toilet we had been, even with the park being so crowded. I am super thankful for all the family toilet they have provided in every toilet, it makes it a breeze to bring a toddler to the park, when it comes to changing their diapers or cleaning the up.Another perk that I love is that we can bring an empty drinking bottle to the park, as there always a drinking fountain/tap to refill our bottle situated nearby the toilets.I am excited and hoping that the new Zootopia Land will be completed and opened soon. We would love to return again one day.",5.0,"The reviewer made a second visit to the park and found it as magical as their first visit, despite the long queues, especially during national holidays. They highlighted the value of the express lane which is worth the money if queues are beyond 60 minutes. The reviewer preferably suggests the Tron ride, and appreciated the park's Halloween decorations in October. They noted the cleanliness of the park and the availability of family-friendly facilities like toilets. They also enjoyed the perk of being able to refill their drinking water within the park. Additionally, they showed anticipation for the completion and opening of Zootopia Land, expressing a desire to visit again."
"Weâ€™re a couple from the UK and big Disney fans. Weâ€™d booked  holiday to China which ended in Shanghai and we decided to visit Disneyland. I tried doing a bit of research about the place which in the end didnâ€™t prove that helpful. Firstly, downloading the app and buying the tickets online - we downloaded the app whilst in the UK. Tickets were only available/released 10 days to two weeks in advance so donâ€™t worry if your date isnâ€™t showing for a months time. The app was very slow whether in the UK or in China but worked much better in China on a Chinese Wi-Fi. Due to the timings we had to wait until we were in China to book the tickets on the app. Iâ€™d read things about huge queues so opted for one of the premier access (fast pass) packages. It cost us Â£300 for two one day park tickets with six fast passes each. The fast passes were ride specific and there are different options depending on the rides you want. You can also buy individual fast passes. Iâ€™d read about huge queues and didnâ€™t want to rely on free fast passes that we might not get so thatâ€™s why I opted for the package. We also bought a one day PhotoPass for around Â£25. Once youâ€™ve bought the tickets in the app itâ€™ll say youâ€™ll get a text and email confirmation for the purchase but I got neither but had took screen shots just in case. The purchase will appear on your app, go to the â€˜meâ€™ section at the bottom where youâ€™ll have to fill in the guest names and passport numbers of the guests for each ticket. YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PASSPORTS WITH YOU. All tickets in China seem to be attached to your passports for security reasons and you wonâ€™t be let in without your passports. They will then give you a paper ticket once at the turnstile at the entrance to the park and you wonâ€™t need your passports again. The PhotoPass is a coupon on the app that youâ€™ll need to get redeemed in the park at one of several locations, it tells you where in the app but we went to cosy corner, itâ€™s the first shop on your right on Mickey Avenue (what would normally be Main Street USA). Youâ€™ll need to download the Disney PhotoPass app too which is where your photos will appear, the cast members will help you and show you. Regardless of whether youâ€™ve had the pass activated, the first time you get to a photographer youâ€™ll be given a card with a QR code on which will be scanned like your band would be in Orlando, every time they take a photo and all photos will appear on the app. You can purchase individual prints of photos at the park or you can have them digitally by buying the PhotoPass. It shows you the photo opportunities on the map of the park in the app. When we went there was no paper map, itâ€™s all on the app. We went on Saturday 16 September which was after the school holidays. Despite it being a Saturday it wasnâ€™t too busy. The longest queue time was 60mins for the seven dwarves mine train which we had a fast pass for. Tron had a 30 minute wait time and so we queued once for it and used the fast pass the next time. Pirates of the Caribbean had a 15 minute wait time so we queued and did that twice too. We got straight on the crystal grotto and queued half an hour for Peter Pan. We went to the Pirates of the Caribbean stunt show which isnâ€™t in English but was still worth seeing (bear with it). Meeting characters has longer wait times for 40-60 minutes, which we didnâ€™t bother with. Another thing to add, no commentary is in English on any of the rides. The parade does have English bits mainly due to the songs, same with the nighttime illuminations at the castle. The park in general is bigger than I thought, I thought it would be on a par with Paris but it was bigger. It has five (I think) lands to it, each has a guest services which have a board up telling you show times etc. Thereâ€™s plenty of western style food, we had pizza from the Pinocchio tavern and we saw burgers in the restaurant in Tomorrowland. Thereâ€™s free water fountains throughout the park and the water tastes normal (not like the matchstick flavoured water of Orlando). Disneytown is the food and shopping area (like a mini Disney Springs) and has the only Starbucks in the park (which doesnâ€™t do anything Disney themed) but is big with indoor and outdoor seating. It is on the side of the park as if another land but you have to pass through security to get in and out of the park, the queue was minimal on the day we went. Itâ€™s hot and humid so prepare for this, my hair turned wild and my Disney themed T-shirt was stuck to me from the moment we arrived. Drink plenty of water. You can pay with credit/debit card at the bigger outlets and restaurants. I had downloaded Alipay but it only works with an internet connection. There is free Wi-Fi in the park which works nicely. Take a power bank! There are ones you can borrow for free in the park that you pay a refundable deposit for through Alipay or similar, however, you have to attach a phone number and it wouldnâ€™t work for us. It appeared you needed a Chinese mobile number. The cast members donâ€™t speak a lot of English but will use a translate app and are very willing to help you. Yeh toilets are very clean with plenty of western style toilets and loo roll (not a given as standard in China). Itâ€™s definitely worth a visit, we loved it. My only complaint, there werenâ€™t any Christmas decorations for sale due to it not being Christmas.",4.0,"The reviewer, a die-hard Disney fan from the UK, visited Disneyland in Shanghai during a holiday in China. They caution that all tickets must be booked online in advance and advise visitors to download the slow, but passable, Disneyland app for ticket confirmation. Despite concerns about queues, they purchased a 'Fast Pass' package to avoid the anticipated wait times, which cost them around £300 for two one-day tickets. They also bought a one-day PhotoPass for approximately £25. A visit to Disneyland Shanghai requires passports for security reasons, and visitors must note that ticket confirmations may not be sent via email or text, so they should screenshot their purchase. The Disneyland app is essential for character, photopass, and park information but is also the"
"The worst theme park is Disneyland. I cannot express my negative feelings. Firstly, you walk about 2 kilometers from the taxi collection point to the theme park gate. Secondly, it was very crowded. Thirdly, it was extremely hot and humid. Fourthly, filming with the characters was crowded for about an hour. Fifthly, there is no organization or map in English regarding show times. Sixth, all the rides were crowded. Seventh, the services. Disney ice cream or sweets taste very bad, not delicious, like Disney Orlando, Disney Hong Kong, or Disney Japan. Eighth, I did not encounter any employee at Shanghai Disney, whether in the hallways or at the rides, who spoke English, German, or Spanish. For me it was a waste of time and money",1.0,"The reviewer is extremely dissatisfied with their experience at Disneyland Shanghai, describing it as the worst theme park. They complained about the long walk from the taxi collection point to the park entrance, overcrowding, and extreme heat and humidity. They also experienced long wait times to take pictures with characters and ride attractions. Lack of facility maps and show times in English lead to further frustration. The reviewer felt the food, such as Disney ice cream or sweets, was of poor quality and they also expressed disappointment about the lack of staff who could speak English, German or Spanish. They felt their visit was a waste of both time and money."
"We decided to go for visiting Shanghai Disney in order to celebrate the 50th birthday of one of the participants - the main challenge in the theme park are the long waiting queues - on the Monday we visited (one day ahead of local Summer vacation over), waiting lanes were 2-3 hours for the main attractions - this is obviously is too much for the price you are paying for entrance fees. Therefore value for money is difficult to be judged in a proper way. You can take tons of nice photos and also enjoy the park - however, at one point of time people get tired from waiting and / or walking - restaurants in the park are expensive and not really tasty but fit the purpose - all in all nice place but far away from downtown and other attractions in Shanghai.",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disney for a 50th birthday celebration, but found the long waiting queues a main challenge. Even on a weekday, before summer vacation began, main attraction lines were 2-3 hours long. This resulted in them questioning the value for the money they spent on entrance fees. Despite this, they enjoyed taking many photos and the general atmosphere of the park. They found the park restaurants overpriced and not particularly tasty, although convenient. They also pointed out the park's distant location from downtown Shanghai and other sites. Overall, they found the park enjoyable, but cited several drawbacks."
"The most beautiful, clean and amazing Disneyland I have ever visited! I have visited every Disneyland in the world and so glad I saved this for last!",5.0,"The reviewer highly praises this particular Disneyland, describing it as the most beautiful, clean, and amazing one they have experienced. They add that they've been to all the Disneyland parks in the world, expressing satisfaction that they visited this one last."
"Any day you will find immensely large crowds but using the app you can pay for the priority queue. In our case for some rides this reduced lines of 2hrs down to 20 mins. Cost is the equivalent of 20 euro per person per ride. Pricey but not worth the wait otherwise (in my view) In the evening, especially during dinner time, the queues get a bit less lengthy which is good. Food is also decent, nothing like the street food crap you would get in EU or US disneyland. Kids loved it. Seems the girls really dress up for this (be prepared for a gazillion princesses) So convenient to be able to get here by metro instead of a long arduous drive. If you want to go shopping there is a disney world shop just outside the park gates which is open one hour longer beyond park closing time.",5.0,"The user mentioned that the location experiences large crowds daily, but using an app to pay for priority queuing can dramatically reduce wait times from 2 hours to 20 minutes, at a cost of 20 euros per person per ride. Though pricey, the user finds it more convenient. They noted that queues are less lengthy during dinner time. The user praised the food for being decent and not like the typical street food found in EU or US Disneyland. Kids especially enjoyed their time and there were many girls dressed as princesses. They appreciated the convenience of reaching the location via metro. There is also a shopping option available at a Disney World shop located outside the park gates which stays open an hour after the park closes."
"This is Disneyland, I have been here twice by subway. It is also good to drive, a big parking zone.I suggest you spend a full day here and watch the firework at night.You will never forget this.",5.0,"The reviewer recommends visiting Disneyland, having had positive experiences both times they went. They suggest it's easily accessible by subway or car, with ample parking available. They advise dedicating an entire day to fully appreciate the park and highly endorse the nighttime firework display."
"There are many rides, good atmosphere, cool weather and delicious food.  Just some fun toys  There are princesses and princes who dress up beautifully and handsomely.",5.0,"The review highlights numerous positive aspects such as a variety of rides, an enjoyable atmosphere, favorable weather conditions, and tasty food offerings. It also mentions the presence of beautifully and handsomely dressed characters like princesses and princes, which add to the overall fun experience."

The euphoria from the costumes, songs will magically  transport you to yesteryear.The castle looks magical, the tour was amazing. I loved the parade. The singing was a bit off, but bearable.The food court was packed, the food was okay.Caution, never go during holidays. Went during National holidays. We thought it's a ""rainy"" day, it will not be packed. It cleared up and we got through the lines quicker with passports. But there were long lines everywhere - for rides, food, bathrooms.It was nice seeing kids with the Minnie Mouse ear headbands,  balloons, decor etc.",3.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience at the park, finding it to be a transportive experience that evokes childhood memories and creates a feeling of being in another world. They appreciated the costumes, songs, castle, and tour, along with the parade, despite some issues with the singing. However, they found the food at the food court to be just okay and pointed out that it was quite crowded. The reviewer suggests avoiding visiting during National holidays due to long lines for rides, food, and bathrooms. They enjoyed seeing kids wearing Minnie Mouse ear headbands and the park's decorations."
"Best Disneyland I have been to! (So farâ€¦) I have Been to a variety of Disneylandâ€™s, Paris and a few others, but I would have to Say this was the best one Iâ€™ve been to!

They find it magical and believe it deserves a five-star rating."
"After experiencing Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney Shanghai is a big disappointment.  There don't seem to be any rides and all of the rides they do have, you need to line up for hours just to ride.  We got there and got through the gates just after 10am and left at 8pm and were able to go on only 4 rides!  The parade was very short, with only a couple of floats.  The food up near Iron had a vegan burger which I thought was good.  It has the feel of Disney yet something seems to be missing.",3.0,"The user had a disappointing experience at Disney Shanghai, finding it inferior to Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim. They complained about the lack of rides and the long waits required to ride them, managing only four rides in a ten-hour period. The parade was also deemed unsatisfactory due to its short length and lack of floats. However, they did enjoy a vegan burger at one of the food outlets. Despite having a Disney atmosphere, the user felt the park was missing something."
A pretty magical place.Rides were amazing and the experience smooth and easy even with small kids in tow. Recommend two days and hotel stay to get the most value. Early entry and fast pass invaluable.Dining experience in the park was poor; best eat in the village outside the gates.Fireworks show on Xmas day was an unforgettable experience. Upon leaving my thoughts turns to when I’ll come back…,5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful experience at this amusement park, stating it is magical and suitable even for those with young children. They suggest staying for two days and using early entry and fast pass for the best experience. Dining inside the park wasn't satisfactory but the food in the village outside was better. The fireworks display on Christmas Day was highlighted as a remarkable experience. Overall, the reviewer is looking forward to their next visit."
Lovely visit. Not many exciting rides but nice to walk around. Food is not that good as it is of food court style. Better to dine at Disneytown. Mickey’s Parade was fun. Fireworks display at night was fantastic.,4.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit due to pleasant walking areas, a fun Mickey's Parade, and a fantastic nighttime fireworks display. However, they found the park lacking in exciting rides and were disappointed with the food court style dining, recommending eating at Disneytown instead."

So great and totally worth a visit , good rides, good food in the town just a magical happy place .",5.0,"The reviewer finds the place magical and exceptional, particularly during Christmas.

"It was pretty good. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but I personally prefer the ones in America as the rides are more exciting.",4.0,"The review indicates a generally positive experience. However, the reviewer states a personal preference for the American versions of the location or attraction, citing more exciting rides."
"Me and my partner had a bad experience at Disneyland. We purchased two nights at the Toy Story Hotel and tickets for the second day. When we arrived, three members of staff all told us that we needed to go to Disney Town the next morning to collect the tickets. So at 07:00 in the morning, we took a bus to Disney Town..But we were told by the staff there that there was no record or proof that we had purchased the tickets and that we needed to get confirmation from the hotel! So this meant, me and my partner, taking the bus BACK to the hotel only for them to give us tickets to get in to the park. What a mess! It really ruined our mood. At first I thought it could have been a misunderstanding, but we are both fluent in Chinese and English, yet they said the same thing in both languages. Lack of experience? I don't know. But it really ruined our experienced as we didn't get into the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded.",1.0,"The user and their partner had a poor experience at Disneyland, mainly due to an issue with ticket collection. They had booked a two-night stay at the Toy Story Hotel along with park tickets. However, they faced communication issues with the staff about the collection of tickets from Disney Town. Despite going there early in the morning, they were told that there was no record of their ticket purchase. The confusion led to them having to travel back to the hotel to retrieve their tickets, which ruined their mood. The mix-up caused them to enter the park later than intended, resulting in a crowded experience. The issue persisted despite the couple's fluency in both English and Chinese."
"Visited the park in 2019, pre-Covid and had a blast.The queues weren’t too bad, as we found out we picked quite a good day for our visit and we were able to enjoy almost all of the attractions we were interested in.Even on a not so busy day, some of the attractions were a bit busy and we were thinking that a fast pass would have been a good idea…but then again, the concept of fast passes is a bit of a wallet burning idea.TRON ride is a unique experience that was something else and we really enjoyed Star Wars hall - the 2 meters high Lord Vader was stealing the show.The Pirates of the Caribbean are also a must, as the visual effects are incredible, especially compared to some European parks.Most of us have been to a few amusement parks and this was one of the better ones - however, you should come prepared, as the prices inside are quite high and English translations are not present everywhere.",5.0,"The reviewer had a great time visiting the park in 2019, before Covid. They managed to visit most of the attractions they were interested in, due to less crowded queues. However, they felt that a fast pass could have been beneficial for the busier attractions, despite it being expensive. They were impressed by specific rides like the unique TRON and the visually stunning Pirates of the Caribbean. The Star Wars hall, especially the tall Lord Vader, was a standout. They cautioned that the park's prices are high and not all signs have English translations. Despite this, they considered it one of the more superior amusement parks they had visited."
"I am a huge fan of Florida’s Disney World and have been to Disneyland California and Hong Kong. When I moved to China I was very excited to visit this Disneyland the first chance I had. With that said, while the overall experience was fun and had Disney magic, I was a little disappointed. From what I have read the park had changed post-COVID and not for the better.Bottom Line: if you’re a Disney super fan like me and prepared for huge crowds the beauty and uniqueness of this park is worth it. Otherwise the crowds and long lines without free fastpass make this park a challenge!!Details:1) be prepared for HUGE crowds. We went on a weekday and I would hate to see it on a weekend. LONG lines for everything, even bag check + entry turnstiles took about 1.5 hrs (standing in hot direct sun). 2) We arrived 1.5 hours before park opened and got in 5 minutes after opening. The line for some big rides (Soarin) was already almost 3 hours. They do sell early access passes so this might be worth it but I think with crowds from the resorts entering early it would still be very busy.3) Fastpass. This was the biggest and most frustrating change of all. There are NO free fastpass. You can buy fastpass in packages or for single rides but it’s EXPENSIVE- one pass was 180RMB or about $28!! That’s crazy. And with the giant lines…you have to choose either to just wait or pay up. :/4) As for lines- as a frequent visitor of WDW in Florida I was very surprised that early morning lines were actually longer than late morning-early afternoon. Keep an eye on the wait times in the app and try to ride during the afternoon, parades, etc. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Tron had manageable (1 hr or less) lines during the night shows so this is a good option if you’re not watching the night show. As for the night show, plan to stake out a spot around 6:30 for the 8pm show if you want a decent view of the castle.5) The food is not good and is very expensive (more expensive than WDW). Many people have posted that you can’t bring in food; this is not the case in 2021. We packed plenty of snacks but in hindsight I wish we would have packed actual lunch/dinner food. If you do have to eat in the park, Tangled Tree Tavern wasn’t bad. The slightly better and slightly less expensive food is just outside the park in Disneytown- a separate area you can enter/exit throughout the day with your park ticket. The ice cream in Disneytown is very good and will only set you back about $5 instead of the $10 charged in the park.6) The Tron and Pirate rides are amazing!! Even impressed my husband who is not as much of a Disney fanatic. :)7) The park is beautiful and SO BIG! The attention to detail you expect from Disney was amazing.8) We live in China so we were prepared for “Chinese” behavior, which may come as a shock to other visitors. Yes, there is a lot of pushing and crowding. And we did see one little boy peeing on the pavement in front of the castle. Be prepared for pushing and other things you won’t see in America. It’s just China and it’s shocking and gross but you aren’t in America after all! Also the shows and rides are mostly in Mandarin and staff generally speaks little English.also download the Shanghai Disney app and a good VPN (we use ExpressVPN) before you come.As of July 2021 there are very little COVID measures. You have to buy/book your ticket in advance but there’s no social distancing and infrequent mask wearing.",4.0,"The reviewer, a self-proclaimed Disney fan, visited Disneyland Shanghai, China, with mixed experiences. While they appreciated the beauty, uniqueness, and the amazing Tron and Pirates rides, several drawbacks were listed. Large crowds resulted in long lines for everything, even on a weekday and particularly in the early morning. Furthermore, the absence of free Fastpass was a major frustration as it required the choice between standing in long lines or paying a significant sum to bypass them. They described the food as not being tasty and overpriced, but clarified that, contrary to previous information, visitors are in fact allowed to bring in their own food (as of 2021). The reviewer was prepared for what they deemed ""Chinese behavior,"" such as pushing and crow"
"I booked a 2 day pass on the official website before arrive in Shanghai (around ¥800 weekday 2 day ticket).The subway line 11 arrives straight into the resort! Make sure you buy a return ticket as soon as you arrive! (it will save time when you return)!Day 1: Great day, weather wasn’t the best! It rained which meant that a few rides were suspended until the storm had passed! There is a parade at 12:15pm which is worth watching! Around a 1 hour and less wait for the rides!Day 2: Another great day, although this was a Friday. The park seemed much busier. There were 1/2 hours waits for the rides!There are a mixture of Chinese and western food! The bakery is a much visit!",5.0,"The reviewer visited a resort in Shanghai which is conveniently accessible via subway line 11. They recommend purchasing return tickets immediately upon arrival to save time. They booked a 2-day pass for about ¥800. The first day was enjoyable despite some bad weather and suspended rides. They highlight a parade at 12:15pm and an average waiting time of less than an hour for rides. The second day was busier, as it was a Friday, creating waiting times of half an hour. The food options were a mix of Chinese and western, specifically pointing out the bakery as worth visiting."
"I don’t understand what is the fuss about with most people who visited Shanghai Disneyland. It’s a theme park and it WILL be crowded from time to time. And this is China. There WILL be people.We visited the park for four consecutive days buying two 2-day tickets each and found this was totally worth it every yuan. The staff at the park are polite, helpful, kind to children and help out however they can. The rides are great! Yes there are queues, and if one plans timings well, like missing the morning parade to do a “Soaring over the Horizon”, or doing TRON during Chinese dinner time, one will find practically no queues. I did buy a fast pass, only because we didn’t want to wait for 60 mins as we wanted to finish Winnie The Pooh ride and go for lunch. It’s a personal choice.If I were only with adults, queues are no big deal, but with little children I preferred a fast pass one day for a chosen ride.Food in the park is good. Limited options for vegetarians like me, but one can always go into Disneytown, eat and come back with the same ticket. It’s allowed! I find that extremely convenient!!!One can never cover everything in the park even after 4 days. It’s really big compared to HK. We loved the park although I wish they should add some specific timings for the English narration of the Pooh ride.We shall return!",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit to Shanghai Disneyland, despite acknowledging it as a typical crowded theme park. They recommend planning well to avoid long lines at rides. Purchasing a fast pass was also suggested, especially when visiting with children. They found the staff at the park to be polite and helpful. While food options for vegetarians in the park were limited, there was the convenient option to dine at Disneytown and re-enter the park. They appreciated the park's size but would like English timings for the Pooh ride. They considered the 2-day tickets worth the cost, and plans to return."
"To enter the park you need to walk from the car park, queue up for the security check, and pass the ticket office, this is a long walk, and took 90 mins. As you must reserve your ticket at least 1day in advance, remember to bring your ID with you ( photo of your passport is fine. The park is massive, today involved a lot of walking and queueing. The top attraction waiting time was constantly three hours so we missed it out but with Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron there was plenty to do.Left tired but happy twelve hours later",4.0,"The reviewer warns of a 90-minute long walk from the car park, through security, and to the ticket office at the park, and advises to reserve tickets at least a day in advance and bring an ID. The park is significantly large and involves lots of walking and queueing. Despite missing the top attraction due to a three-hour wait, they found other activities like Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron to enjoy. Their twelve-hour visit left them tired but happy."
"ADVICES to save time and nerves:GET Disnay APP in advance . Be VERY VERY early. BUy transparent water-resistant neck purse for the phone to make videos of your rides. BRING your food with you. IT will save you time.BAD app system. Presumably, you can book a ""stand by pass"" (which used to be free fast pass )  in the official Disney app, once you have a real paper ticket on hands and link it. BUT....its gets fully booked in the first 10 mins after the first people get in and nothing was available after that. WELL DONE, Disnay!  it was a very frustrating part!  PLEASE go back to manual stands inside the park where people used to book 1 free pass for every 2 hours!!!!!! it Was FAIR to everyone!You can buy a fast pass package for single or multiple rides on app. We took most expensive 800 rmb (additionally to 400 rmb ticket)  per person. So tot 1300 gives you access to fast pass of pre-selected by Disney 6 rides (we did 7 or 8 in total from 8:40 till 15:00) . It was a nice experience.The service was good (we exchanged 1 atraction, as there were technical issues with  1 ride on the list. so we changed it, )l personnel was very helpful and well trained.I gave 3 stars because of the system glitch (was on and off during the day) and the MAIN point because we haven't got a single stand-by pass. This  SYSTEM doesn't really work !",3.0,"The user is providing advice for those planning a Disney trip. They recommend downloading the Disney app, arriving very early, buying a transparent, water-resistant neck purse for phones, and bringing your own food. They found booking on the app to be frustrating, especially regarding ""stand by passes"" which used to be free and manually booked within the park. They ended up buying a more expensive fast pass package, but still found the experience worthwhile and enjoyed good service from helpful staff. They gave the experience 3 stars due to system glitches and issues with booking passes."
"If you want to spend the day spending lots of money and then lining up then this is your place!  We tried to go on a day that might not have the crowds. That was ambitious. I don't think there is every a day like that. It seemed like there aren't a lot of great rides but we did love Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan and Woody's Roundup. We certainly got our step count up as you wander all over all day to try to get to the places with the least line up time. The Disney app is great for letting you know the line times. Food in park is pretty poor as is available seating in restaurants...or lack of.  I'd say this was an ""okay"" Disneyland. People pushing a lot and say good bye to social distancing especially when lining up for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The personal space thing is something to navigate here.  Kids peeing through the fence in the line-ups (parents were there) wasn't a good thing.",3.0,"The reviewer felt that the location, possibly a Disneyland, requires significant spending and often has large crowds, regardless of the day of the week. The reviewer also indicated that they didn't enjoy a majority of the rides, but they did praise a select few, including Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan, and Woody's Roundup. They also appreciated the Disney app for providing line times. However, the reviewer criticized the food quality in the park and the lack of available seating in restaurants. They also had some hygiene concerns and noted a lack of personal space, particularly in line for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The reviewer rated their experience as ""okay""."
"We have moved back to China, now living in Shanghai after many years in the north.Went to Disneyland with the kids (8 and 6 years old) a well as my wife’s sister and dad.While we are quite experienced to crowds, Disneyland goes the little extra yard to ensure the full experience of waiting in lines, being pushed, wasting time and at the same time feeling that the whole thing is setup with only one purpose, namely, to get the last RMB out of your pockets before you leave.It was to be honest not a very pleasant trip and while my wife and I fast agreed that now we have visited this place once and sworn never to come back, it was more surprising that the kids during the day also started to complain. My wiffe’s dad? He left at 6:30 pm as he could not stand it anymore (old grumpy man! :-))The good•	Overall clean and nice environment•	Some parts of the park were not too overcrowded (comparing to Chinese standards) so walking around between the different worlds was manageable.•	While we did not try very many rides due to waiting in-line, the TRON Lightcycle Power Run was fun (if you can absorb the 50 min wait and further 20 min wait due to a break down)•	The fireworks/light show was impressive (if you can absorb the wait time and the pushing and shoving)•	Easy to get to, Shanghai Subway runs to the door.The bad•	Pricing. It is obviously not cheap. Please note that the price anchor in China for such things are set high so you will have to pay, which we expected, but again Disneyland just goes that little extra yard to ensure your pockets are completely swiped when you are gone. Entrance price, while not dirt cheap was not really excessive (we paid RMBB 499/adults, 399/children which is ok), however they go to great length to ensure you end up paying extras.•	Food, you must buy food and drinks inside. They have a security check before ticket purchase with the aim to swipe foods from those who brings it (we did not). It adds an extra 30-40 minutes wait-in-line to the experience and we saw quite a few that god food confiscated…my bad feelings started just there. Inside prices are excessive, particular when comparing to standard Chinese prices which on food are low. I will not do a full price list of horrors here, but let me put it this way – I originate from Scandinavia which is by most people (and by facts) considered expensive. In Disneyland their corndog/hotdog on stick like thing was priced with a +100% premium of what a hotdog runs me back in Denmark…so be warned!•	Stores and restaurants are all over and take up a considerably part of the part, in fact in hindsight there are actually only a few attractions given the size of the complex and not lest given the number of visitors they admit in.•	Which leads me the next profit maximizing item, the “jump the line pass”. Having assured that all fun rides are cramped, Disneyland has studied the book “The confessions of the Pricing man” on how to ripe the benefits of this in setting prices that allows you to skip the lines they created. After we arrived and discovered the waiting times for the rides we briefly considered buying one of the skip-the-line passes, but they ran at RMB 1,000 per person (2x adult entrance fee, 2½x children entrance fee) and could maximum be used 8 times! (that is an extra RMB 125 per ride). To be fair they had a whole price range for various skip-the-line passes with allowance for fewer rides, but the price per ride of these were same (actually slightly higher). You come to the suspicion (extremely fast) that it is all a well/evil planned profit maximizing scheme.The uglyWhile everyone that lives in, have lived in or just have been to China knows, crowds are plenty and all over, and this is an integrated part of live, planning and society setup.So having large crowds in Disneyland was be no means any surprise.However, it seemed to have surprised the planners as the number of attractions and particularly the capacity of these by no means matched the number of people let into the park at once.We arrived when the park opened, admittedly go were not in until at least 50 minutes after due to the food swiping exercise at the entrance, but on the advice of my wife’s sister we headed straight to the Soaring over the Horizon ride only to discover that the waiting time was….3 hours! (to be honest I though they were playing me a joke, but no).They had a standby pass system on the app which allows to the reserve time for waiting later…it does not allow you to arrive at a certain time and then avoid waiting. But that system suffered under crowd pressure as well. I managed to make one booking (for myself) but once I tried to add my wife, children, wife’s sister no more time slots were available…and that was that! (not even mentioning since we were six incl. my wife’s dad and the system only allowed groups up to five it was a bit useless for us)After the initially frustrations we then decided to get the best out of the day and try as many rides as we could. We tried the Roaring Rapids (60 mins wait), the Dwarfs mining Train (45 min wait), Rex Riders (90 min wait), TRON power race (50 mins wait + 20 mins break down wait) and the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle (45 min wait) plus my children tried the Dumpo ride, the shipwreck, saw a couple of the characters standing within fenced areas and the youngest also went to the sign along with Elsa/Frozen while the oldest was doing the TRON race.Particularly the Rex Riders was a complete joke. It had a capacity of 20! Low and behold! I guess the person coming up with that idea have never been to China before, at least he did not coordinated with the guy planning for how many to let in on any given day.We also decided to see the 8pm fireworks/lightshow and was advised to be there no later than 7pm if the children should have a chance to see it. We ended up waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for the experience and as time passed more and more people showed up ending in constant pushing, shoving and being in constant physical contract with at least the nearest 3-4 people around you (Ironically the recorded announcer was every 15 minutes welcoming people to the event and telling them to keep social distancing and not blocking other people view…yeah right, maybe if you let 10,000 less people in it would be possible). The had reserved areas which had no people but these were for the people selling snacks, obviously!The really scaring part of the visit came when the show ended as the masses then started to leave. We we quickly decided to carry both children on held each other’s cloth not to lose each other in the black sea of people. It was insane (even for Chinese standards) one step in the wrong direction and we would not have found each other again. So flowing with the masses we (luckily) had to go the exit and the metro station because that was where the masses few to.To think this is a place for children!We came to the place around 8:40 am and left around 8:30pm. A full 12 hours, I tried 4 rides, my children maybe 6 maybe 7, we ate once while sitting, we ate a bit while walking, we saw the parade and besides walking from place to place we spent the rest of the time waiting in line.So be warned, it is a multi-billion dollar brand and by this alone they will attract enough visitors but the experience was noting close to magic, unless it is magic to wait in endless lines and get pushed and shoved.I ranked it, very generously, two starts, due to the parts mentioned under “the good”, but price and value experience does simply not match up. As a benchmark we in the summer had visited both Tivoli Gardens and Bakken amusement parks in Copenhagen, which are both high recommendable. Here the children tried rides all the time (at Bakken my oldest and I managed to run out of rides on the old wooden roller coaster on our access pass, which meant 10 rides on that ride alone). All within the same time spend and at total price that was half to a third of what we spent at Disneyland and with a much cozier atmosphere.The final curiosum is that Walt Disney actually build his Disneyland based on the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen after he had visited the park back in the 50s. His successors have failed miserably with that task in Shanghai.",2.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland with his family and had an overall unpleasant experience. Positives included an overall clean environment, manageable crowd sizes in parts of the park, some enjoyable rides like the TRON Lightcycle Power Run, an impressive fireworks/light show, and easy accessibility through the subway. However, there were numerous negatives. 

The reviewer felt that the theme park was too expensive, both for the entrance and additional costs inside, including the food, which customers are required to buy inside after any food they bring is confiscated. The reviewer also felt that there were too many stores/restaurants and too few attractions for the size of the park and the number of visitors admitted at once. The park's 'skip-the-line' pass was also criticized for its price"
"Not much to say that hasn't already been said here, but if you're considering going around this time, definitely do it! We visited on January 6th (a Wednesday) and did not need to wait for a single ride! There are quite a few shows to watch throughout the day and quite a few good rides for adults. You can't miss TRON!If you aren't sure whether you'd like to visit or not, you can download the app now to monitor the wait times around the time you plan to visit.From our experience keeping an eye on the waiting times in the app before our trip:If you go during a more busy time of the year, I recommend getting there before the park opens and running straight to Soaring over the Horizon first as it seems to always have the longest wait time. The lines seemed to dwindle down at the very end of the day (after 6:30 pm), as well, if you can save your energy until then.",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends visiting the amusement park, as they had a positive experience with no wait times for rides, especially on a weekday. They highly recommend several shows and rides suited for adults, particularly TRON. To manage your time efficiently, they suggest downloading the park's app to check the wait times. If visiting during peak times, the reviewer advises getting there early to avoid long lines, especially for the popular ride, Soaring over the Horizon. Also, they mention that lines tend to be shorter after 6:30 pm."
"I have been there once before and wanted to take my husband there. I wanted to try out the subway. The subway was easy and fast. Not too hard to find the right gate to get out. Signs were not the best but one can ask and figure it out.My disappointment was at the check point of the park, three "" Happy Host""s were not knowledgeable and unfriendly, they were not happy and not helpful and had no clue how to help, very disappointed for a fun place like this.They did not direct us to the right direction, they simply disappeared. We went around to look for the right gate to enter for a while.  They re rounted ppl due to Covid and did not bother to direct the guests.Same experice with the ticket counter lady, the gate employees, no one was happy, no professional smile,  not to mention being cheerful. sad to see.  And not helpful. They are just not happy to see the guests.The cleaning lady at the Treasure was helpful thoguh, I appreciate that.I had fun dispite this, because the Covid, less ppl at the park, less wait, much faster for the lines.Ate at the Cheesecake Factry, that was nice and noted the ppl also are not very friendly.",2.0,"The reviewer visited a park and had a relatively satisfactory experience navigating the subway to get there, despite unclear signage. However, they were unhappy with the customer service at the park, citing that the hosts and employees were unhelpful and unfriendly, particularly with regards to the new routing due to Covid-19. The reviewer had a better time once inside, as there were fewer people and thus faster lines because of Covid-19. They ate at the Cheesecake Factory, but also found the staff there to be lacking in friendliness. However, they did appreciate the helpfulness of a cleaning lady at a place called the Treasure. Despite the negative interactions with the staff, the reviewer still managed to have fun."
"Good place to visit especially for couples and families. Various different activities compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and Los Angeles Disneyland.  A fun place to be  to spend the whole day. The place is very far from the city so it's better to go early.  A very important advise is to choose a weekday and a day where not many people would show up or else you would wait for hours just to enjoy 1 ride.  Comfortable clothes and shoes are important as the place is huge.  Don't carry any glassware,  food as they will ask you to store it in their locker.  Well compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and the one in Los Angeles the customer service is not great.  Staff don't smile and looks very serious whereas in other Disneyland properties all the Disney staff are smiling and dancing.",4.0,"This review describes a Disneyland park as a fun, family-friendly destination with a variety of activities, distinct from its Hong Kong and Los Angeles counterparts.

"What an amazing experience. While visiting the park, we stayed at Toy Story Hotel who were great in giving us advice on how the park operates as far as early entry, fast pass, and so on. We spent some time the day before visiting the park looking around Downtown Disney, and getting a bit of a lay of the land, which helped us over the following days. On our first day in the park, the weather turned bad, as unbeknownst to us there was a typhoon on the way. This meant the large crowds all rushed to spots for protection, which became frustrating. The bad weather forced the closure of many of the rides. The park emptied out, which meant lines that were normally an hour wait were 10 minutes or less, so we pushed on through and took the weather as part of our Disney experience.Within the park there was always a cast member no too far away to help out, and all had a good understanding of English.Due to the typhoon that hit Shanghai, the park was closed for the day that was to be our second day at the park, but the staff transferred all of our fast passes  and entry, and we had no obstacles getting into the park and enjoying it again the following day which was a hidden blessing as the crowds had dwindled down quite a bit. Too many individual highlights to list, but Soaring Over the Horizon, Pirates Of The Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train were right up there.  I would definitely visit again if i was able to, and would recommend it to anyone, of any age",5.0,"The user had a fantastic experience at the Toy Story Hotel during their visit to the park.

"We purchased our tickets for Disneyland via Klook for a discounted rate around 75 USD each for peak times. For any international visitors you need to have your passport verified as they scan you in. There are plenty of areas to hangout and get photos of and around the castle as opposed to in Disneyland in Anaheim. However, we didn’t really find many cast members that day who take pictures or are around if you have questions. We love to eat so we enjoyed the different foods. We would recommend getting the Donald Waffle and cherry blossoms ice cream, checking out the pastries at Remy’s cafe, trying a barbecue turkey leg near pirates, and the food court in Pinocchio village. Of the rides we would suggest going on Pirates and Tron. We also highly suggest checking out the Tarzan show which is unlike any other Disney show. Because there aren’t many rides at the park the lines are long. They offer traditional fast passes but they sell out very quickly. The day we went all fastpasses for all rides were gone by 1PM. After that you can purchase fastpasses per ride or buy a pack for a handful of rides. On average each fastpass will cost around 10 USD. Lastly, the park unfortunately closes early so they have their main nightly show at 8:30PM and close the park at that time. This show much like the rides incorporates a lot of augmented reality and lights as opposed to a traditional firework show but we really enjoyed the change. For our first Disney experience outside of the US we had a great time and can’t wait to see other parks!- @wanderingwithustwo",5.0,"The review is for a trip to Disneyland bought through Klook at a discounted rate.

"This is our first time back since COVID-19. The park was closed for more than 3 months. Local authorities have imposed a 30% capacity limitation for social distancing reasons. As such, you must first book a slot ahead of your arrival. Else, you will be politely turned away at the door as they are likely to have issued out all the tickets before the day itself.Despite the restrictions, the park still felt pretty crowded (30% would equate to 12,000 people). There are clear markings on the floor to encourage social distancing. Their staff are also at hand to remind visitors to keep a safe distance from each other.All in all, it’s nice to be able to be on the happiest place on earth despite COVID-19.",5.0,"The reviewer visited a park for the first time since COVID-19 restrictions were imposed, requiring pre-booking due to a 30% capacity limitation.

Overall, the reviewer seemed to enjoy being able to visit what they referred to as ""the happiest place on earth"" despite the pandemic."
The world's happy place. The price from Viator  is cheaper than the actual counter. It is very convinient to book on the spot as well. You can bring food in. Better than Hong Kong Disneyland.

Lastly, they reminded future visitors to bring their passports for ticket processing."
"Contrary to much attention the park received from international media, I personally did not have any negative experience with other park visitors, especially from locals. There wasn't any cutting in line or ""rude"" behavior. There was one man smoking in a non-smoking area, though. A cast member immediately asked him to dispose of his cigarette .Pros:- Unique rides and Disney park experience- Rides are fun and diverse enough for varying interests- Interesting food options- Beautiful castle- Can converse with most staff in English- Park is large, but can be explored in one day- Free all-day wifi throughout the parkCons- As usual with Disney parks, food and merchandise are very expensiveTips- Downloading the Shanghai Disneyland app on your phone prior to your visit is a MUST.

"Shanghai Disneyland was the “anchor” for our trip to Shanghai and we had a great day.  We visited not long after the Chinese New Year, and made sure we went on a weekday to avoid the crowds.  Because we only had one day at the park and we wanted to maximize our time, we purchased Concierge Services which gave us access to a number of rides without having to wait in line.  We missed that we needed to enter via the Disney Grand Theater, which is in Disneytown.  We ended up in a somewhat long queue to enter the park and then had to exit to get our special tickets at the theater as the entrance to the theater within the park was not open.The park was not crowded the day we went, so we didn’t really need the special ride access, but it also gave us access to special viewing areas for the parade and fireworks/light show.  Access to those areas was great, and they enforced access!  We rode Tron twice, and I recommend riding at night if you can.  The castle is huge and you can go up in it. They have some rides that are the same as in the US parks, and some different ones.  We noticed a lot of space for expansion and the manager of the concierge lounge at our hotel told us there are plans to build three more parks, which would make Shanghai Disneyland larger than Walt Disney World!We took a taxi from our hotel and the doorman told the driver where we wanted to go, and she got us there, but had to stop several times to ask for directions to the drop off area.  I had a card from our hotel with the address written in Chinese so we could give to a taxi driver on our return.  I was a little worried that we might have problems getting a taxi at the end of the night, but there is a large taxi pick-up area and our driver had no problem finding our hotel.",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience at Shanghai Disneyland, which was the highlight of their trip.

"Amazing syncretism between the Disney experience and the East, specifically the chinese culture. Here you will notice many many differences compared to other parks, but at the same time, everything is familiar.I don't speak Mandarin and it can be frustrating or challenging at some times, since not many things are in English... but it adds an exotic touch to your visit.By far, is the best Disney ever built.

We surprised our daughter with a visit to Shanghai Disney. It was AMAZING!! Our favorite ride was the Tron ride. We got on it multiple times because we don’t have that ride in the U.S. I love the fact that Shanghai Disney gives a fast pass every hour for different rides. We enjoyed our time. I would go back during warmer weather.,5.0,"The reviewer had a great experience at Shanghai Disney, particularly enjoying the Tron ride as it isn't available in the U.S. They appreciated the fact that Shanghai Disney offers a fast pass every hour for different rides.

"First of all, try to be here before their opening time at 9 to avoid long queue. I can't imagine if it's summer. I went with my kids in winter, less crowds, BUT least I expected, it was a bit of long queue on 25th Dec since it is a holiday in Shanghai. But still manageable. Get the map online to help u navigate the area. All in Chinese language. Expect long queue in main attractions like the tron, seven dwarf, slinky dog. Tron is the longest I waited for 1.5-2 hour as well as the seven dwarfs. Bring raincoats, umbrella if u go in winter. Occasionally there will be light showers. Jack sparrows, Peter pan, Winnie the Pooh, are great. There are restaurant, souvenirs shops, rest room. Quite disappointed with some sellers try to sell fake Disney souvenirs on the way out. Overall it's great time to spend with kids& family. My kids had a blast day. Tips: bring snacks/foods, so u can eat it while on long queue. This enables u to enjoy almost all rides. Winter is less crowds, but avoid on Christmas day 25th.",4.0,"The reviewer recommends arriving early at this Shanghai attraction to avoid long queues, especially during the high-traffic time of 9 a.m. A negative aspect mentioned was the long lines for the main attractions like Tron, Seven Dwarf, and Slinky Dog, with waits up to 1.5-2 hours. The reviewer had a positive experience with rides like Jack Sparrow, Peter Pan, and Winnie the Pooh.

"Comparing this Disneyland with the one in Anaheim, it is very different.  It does not have the same rides, and there are more scenic areas for photos.

"A brilliant park and one to tick off the list if you’re a massive Disney fan! Because it was only built in 2016 it still has a crisp sense of newness, however, please be aware that a lot of the cast members don’t speak English well so you might need a translation app if your Mandarin isn’t up to scratch!",5.0,"The reviewer recommends the park to big Disney fans and appreciates its modern, new feel due to being built in 2016. However, they caution that many staff members don't speak English well, suggesting the use of a translation app for those who don't speak Mandarin proficiently."
they just give you one look then say oh your race is blah blah blah.The service is good but their friendliness to adults of African descent isn't the best.,4.0,The reviewer mentions receiving good service but expresses concern about perceived racial bias and a lack of friendliness towards African-descendant adults.
"Firstly, you need to understand that if you are going to almost any theme park it will generally be very busy. Usually I always expect Disney to be busier and this was no exception, would I have liked it to be quieter? Of course! But who wouldn’t? The park itself is very big but seems to be pretty well spread out which may just be to give more freedom for new rides in the future. The rides were amazing especially those which are not currently at any other park e.g. Tron. One of my favourite rides was the Voyage to the Crystal grotto which I would recommend riding twice as a minimum (day and night). Our overall experience was great there were a couple of things which we noticed which aren’t necessarily the parks fault. 1) vegetarian food. Within the park itself the options are limited, we walked from restaurant to restaurant to try and find a vegetarian meal to be told they didn’t have any in at the moment and to try another restaurant, unfortunately even Disneytown didn’t have options, aside from Bread Kitchen which ended up saving myself in particular. I did have the vegetarian burger meal from the stargazer grill which was okay but not great, possibly personal tastes however. 2) general etiquette - people visiting the park had no issue trying to cut queues and a few times we witnessed parents encouraging their children to go to the toilet in a plant when the toilets were a couple of feet away, this is likely cultural.I would recommend getting to the park early, making sure you have the app downloaded and passes scanned in to get your fast passes booked as we found these were gone by around midday. Make sure you take a camera to get pictures of all the little details dotted around the park. The fireworks/projection show on the castle is a must but you need to get in front of the castle at least 30-60 minutes before as people start getting their spots early.Shanghai Disney offer a “Passport” which you can purchase and then go area by area to collect stamps, although aimed at children I am 26 and enjoyed doing it, once you have collected all the stamps you can then take this to the specified shop on Mickey avenue and you get a prize (mine was a Tron Pen) and keep the passport with your completion stamp which just makes for a cute memento from the trip. We did find that most of the stamp machines were broken however if you went into the closest shop they had manual stamps.The only thing we didn’t see much of was character meet and greets dotted around which from Florida, Paris and Hong Kong these tended to be initially at the entrance and then in specified areas of the park.Do not let a few reviews stating the obvious of the park being busy put you off as we found it enjoyable despite the crowds. A trip to Disney is always a good idea!",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience at Disney, highlighting that despite the inevitable crowds, the park is spacious and well-designed. They particularly enjoyed unique rides like Tron and the Voyage to the Crystal grotto, recommending the latter to be ridden twice, once during the day and once at night. However, there were issues with limited vegetarian food options and observed some poor behaviour from other visitors. They advise getting to the park early and securing Fast Passes as they tend to be gone by midday. They also recommend the fireworks show and suggest arriving early to secure a good viewing spot. They enjoyed the ""Passport"" activity offered by the park where visitors collect stamps from different areas to win a prize, which they found to be a fun memento"
"Super! Will come again. First time to Disney land, wonderful experience for kid n family. Game is super but need to take long time for one game. Food was a.bit expensive but was nice",5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful first-time experience at Disneyland with their family, particularly enjoying the games, although they noted a significant waiting time for each one. They found the food good, but pricey. They stated they will visit again."
"The park overall is beautiful and well played out. However there are some small things that could be improved. In order to make full use of the park you will need to download the disney app and connect to the wifi. This way you can use the map to plan your route around and buy fast pass tickets. Unfortunately we found the wifi very difficult to access not having a chinese number and was unable to access all these features. The rides vary in quality. The pirates of the Caribbean was one of the best experiences I've had in a park before I was completely blown away by it. I also really enjoyed the tron attraction too, which is the fastest attraction disney offers. However the final attraction we did soaring over the horizon was terrible. We started off by waiting outside in the rain with no cover to then have to line up around 2 hours for the attraction damp. You can see everyone struggling and people sitting on the floor because their legs and feet are hurting. When we finally got to the attraction there was only english subtitles for the safety instructions not the whole story of what the attraction was for (if they could subtitle the H&S I dont see why they couldn't the rest of the video)so we didnt really know what was going on. Then whilst on the attraction the whole left side of the screen was blurry and it just felt a shame to have waited such a long time for this attraction. If youd like to get fast passes doe this I would reccomend buying them in advance as they sell out very early on. I have previously been to universal and found all the staff to get into character really well and really sell the belief you're in the world of Harry Potter ect however the staff here didnt have that same magical feel. The lights show on the castle at the end of the night was a MUST DO!. It was completely mesmorising seeing the lights and fireworks over the castle. It's worth getting to the castle at least 30 mins before the show starts as the crowds of people will stand and wait before the show to get the best view. I think the park is worth seeing as it's not expensive for tickets however I compared the whole day to universal and completely favoured universal as a day out.",3.0,"The reviewer found the park to be beautiful but noticed some areas for improvement. They had issues with accessing the park's features because they aren't native to China and had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi. They loved the Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron attractions, but were disappointed by Soaring Over the Horizon due to an uncomfortable waiting situation and poor video quality. The reviewer also compared the staff unfavorably to those at Universal Studios, saying they weren't as immersive. However, they highly recommended the nightly lights show on the castle and advised getting there early for a good view. In summary, they felt the park was worth visiting because of the reasonable ticket prices, even though they personally preferred Universal Studios."
"As expected a great show from Disney. Really always a magical experience, but the rides are not extreme, except the TRON ride. Very unique. So if it’s rides you want, go to another park, but if you want  to be transported to another world, this is the place. Watch the shows, the parades, the exhibitions AND the faces of the children when they see magic come alive!!",4.0,"This review praises Disney for consistently delivering a magical experience. While noting that except for the TRON ride, most attractions are not extreme, the reviewer suggests the park is perfect for those who want to feel transported to another world. They highly recommend the shows, parades, and exhibitions, as well as witnessing the joy in children as they witness the magic."
"I visited shanghai Disney land with my friends, even its winter but still many people around. I love the Tron & if you come bit late & you can see the fireworkShow before the closingFun..need be back to try all the game",5.0,The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland during winter and noted that it was still crowded. They particularly loved the Tron ride and mentioned the fireworks show that takes place before closing time. They expressed a desire to return to try all the games.
"Spacious. There may be thousands of visitors but you never feel the crowd. Compared with the older generations of Disney resorts, this is a very well thought through place. Modernised yet retaining the traditional Disney charms. You need a full day to cover the entire theme part.I like the many restaurants serving Asian fare.  Areas that I feel could be improved. #1. The appearance schedule of Disney characters could be clearly publized.  #2. Some elevated grounds could be created specially to facilitate viewing by the kids. #3. The viewing terrace for performance in front of the castle could be extended especially during the fireworks when all other attractions are closed or near closing.",5.0,"The reviewer appreciates the spaciousness of the Disney resort despite the high number of visitors. They liked the blend of modern and traditional Disney charms and suggested dedicating a full day to explore the whole park. They enjoyed the many restaurants offering Asian cuisine. Areas they believe could be improved include a clearer publication of Disney character appearance schedules, creation of elevated grounds for kids' viewing, and extension of the viewing terrace for performances by the castle, particularly during fireworks."
"friendly staff, friendly people, reasonable prices. highly recommend. we will def be going back. Great for kids",5.0,"The review is positive, highlighting the friendly staff and reasonable prices. It recommends this place, particularly for kids, and confirms plans for a return visit."
this Disney isnt as big as Aneheim Disneyland. The place is very new the staff are helpful & friendly if there was a language barrier by the time we waved our arms and pointed on the map what we were looking for we could communicate well enough to get where we wanted. Food really fresh and good. plenty of characters around for pictures.,4.0,"The reviewer highlights that while the Disney park they visited is smaller than Disneyland Anaheim, it has a new feel. They commend the friendly and helpful staff, stating that despite potential language barriers, they were able to communicate effectively through gestures. They enjoyed the fresh and good food, and appreciated the many characters available for photo opportunities."
"I have been to almost every Disney resort around the world (Florida, California, Hong Kong, Paris and now Shanghai) various times, so I know what the standard usually is and should be. They have definitely tried to replicate it here, however the park is tiny (it claims to be the biggest and I am really not sure how? it can be walked around completely in 20-30 mins!) with very few thrill rides. The park is definitely aimed at young children as there are only 2 big rides.We went on 23rd Dec, an off peak Monday and every ride had a huge queue (maximum 210 minutes) and they also closed down the single rider queues as it was so busy. We were there all day and only managed to get on about 3 rides. By lunchtime all fast passes had finished distributing. The third time I went, not only were the park ride queues much longer, but also queues in general, even just to get into the park it took half an hour at least. The park also closed so much earlier than other disneylands i have been to, however, any longer than 4-5 hours here does start to feel like a drag.Luckily I live here so I didn't take too much trouble to travel here, but if I had come here from overseas or even from another Chinese province I would be very disheartened. The Disneytown is very nice to walk around and have a meal at though.",2.0,"The reviewer has extensive experience visiting Disney resorts worldwide and found the Shanghai Disneyland to under-perform compared to other locations. The park is small in size with minimal thrill rides and is mostly catered towards young children. Despite visiting during an off-peak period, they experienced long queues for rides and entry into the park, with singular ride queues being closed due to overcrowding. Fast passes were quickly exhausted and the park closes earlier than other locations. The reviewer advises that spending more than 4-5 hours in the park tends to feel arduous. They appreciated the Disneytown area for its aesthetics and dining experiences, but would have been disappointed if they had travelled internationally specifically to visit this park."
"People are just pushing and cutting on queues.  The staff just didn't bother to manage the crazy crowd. If you can't adapt to their culture, don't go.Don't bother to waste your time there.Go to other Disneyland where everything is in proper order with polite staff.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience due to the unmanaged crowd behavior and the staff's indifference. They advise against visiting if one is not adaptable to such a culture, suggesting that time can be better spent visiting another Disneyland where operations are organized and the staff is courteous."
"Could feel the effort and thought put into the design of the theme park to give a sense of wonder and joy to visitors. We liked the gift shops which were very cute. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was very enjoyable if a little confusing. The Frozen sing-along show was nice enough, but felt somewhat lacking and there was a noticeable lack of kids singing along.  Were the kids in the audience bored like us? It felt like there was a lot of walking between rides and many restaurants and eateries to fill those spaces, and we thought perhaps this was to make up for the crowd, which was larger than most other theme parks we've been to, even in winter.There's a terrible design issue which I felt I had to point out. Some of the toilets had open smoking areas right outside them, and people had to go through the smoking crowd to use them. One time my wife went to the toilet and while I was filling our bottles at a water dispenser I had to endure the smoke from about one (or three) dozen smokers who were spread out around the toilet entrance.",4.0,"The reviewer appreciates the effort put into the theme park's design especially the themed gift shops and the Pirates of the Caribbean show, although they found the latter slightly confusing. The Frozen show could have been better as it didn't engage the children as expected. They noted that the park layout required a lot of walking between rides with several restaurants in between possibly to manage the large crowd. They took issue with the location of open smoking areas right outside the toilets which they had to navigate through. They found this particularly unpleasant when using the water dispenser near a busy toilet entrance."
This Disney simply needs more rides. Having been to all but Tokyo this park was a let down. We aimed for a quieter period but still the waits were near 3 hours on popular attractions. The day can be summed up when my daughter waited 16 minutes in line to order a pretzel. It might be a magical place but this park needs a rethink,2.0,"The reviewer was disappointed with their Disney visit, saying there were not enough rides and the ones available had wait times up to three hours. The reviewer also mentioned long lines for food, with their daughter waiting 16 minutes to order a pretzel. They suggested that the park needs to be rethought for a better visitor experience."
"We pre-booked our tickets and entering Disneyland was not a hassle at all. We booked a two day admission. The first day was gloomy and drizzly but all the rides were open. The skies cleared up after awhile. You see less crowds in December and all of us got to ride our favourites multiple times. No need for fastpass. Best rides are Tron (awesome but scary as reviewed by my sons), Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids (you'll get splashed, so wear a raincoat), Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pan's Flight and the Challenge Trails.",5.0,"The user had a positive experience at Disneyland, appreciating the ease of entry with pre-booked tickets. Despite initial bad weather, all rides were functional and the skies cleared eventually. They enjoyed the benefit of fewer crowds in December, allowing for multiple rides on their favorites without requiring a fastpass. The user highly recommends the Tron, Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pan's Flight, and the Challenge Trails rides."
I went early and had an early entry pass too. Quite a rigmarole to get in with having to show passport and then verified at another point just through the gates. Went straight to the Tron ride to get in quick. After that long queues and using the app wasn't that helpful to book your fastpass. Disappointing eateries.,4.0,"The reviewer had an early entry pass but found the entry process tiring due to numerous verifications. They managed to quickly get on the Tron ride due to their early arrival. However, they faced long queues afterwards and found the fastpass booking through the app unhelpful. The reviewer was also disappointed with the dining options available."
"To be blunt, there is no magic to this place.The first thing you'll notice after getting through the entrance is that people will actively queue up 3 lines deep just to take photos with anyone in costume. Oh, and there are no costumed characters openly walking around the park interacting with visitors. That would be a death sentence.The rides are a pain in the ass. All the good adventure rides will require a mininum 60 minute wait with some getting to 120 mins usually after 12pm. If you don't like that, you can book a fastpass on the disney app. Problem is, those fastpasses only work for evening times, usually just before the park actually closes. Then again, you can bypass all of this by paying an extra $100+ USD for a premiere pass (per person) which only allows you to cut lines once for 8 specified rides.Apart from that, the thing that pissed me off the most here are the endless selfies that the locals all seem hellbent on doing. You'll realise after walking in the park for a bit that the locals just want to take photos. That's it. They're not actually enjoying being there. They just enjoy taking selfies. You go to any gift store and they're all piled there, taking selfies and then running off without buying anything. I saw selfies being made in front of restaurant signs, park benches, popcorn stalls, trees, etc. The girls all like doing the same stupid poses in front of any attraction. The funniest thing is most of them don't smile with their mouths open because they all have bad teeth.Anyway, I've had enough. I had an awful experience and left the park after 3 hours of walking. I don't care if you go or not go. Just be prepared for all the endless selfies.",1.0,"The reviewer overall had a negative experience at this amusement park. They noticed a significant focus on photo-taking, particularly selfies, by the local visitors rather than them truly enjoying the rides or interacting with costumed characters. The lack of characters openly interacting with guests was also highlighted. They also complained about long waiting times for popular rides. Though there's option to bypass lines by buying a premiere pass or booking fastpasses on the park's app, these were seen as negatives due them being expensive or only available at inconvenient times. The reviewer was very frustrated with these aspects and left the park only after 3 hours."
"went there when we visited Shanghai in December.  the weather a little cold but not too bad for me being from canada.  we went with the kids so they were totally excited.  they did a great job for keeping all the disney feel and theme here and kept the excitement as well.  family really enjoyed it as it wasn't too busy at all.  i finally got to go on ""soar"" as it's always busy at orlando.. and the tron ride is super fast.  the food was good and i was really impressed that there was a subway station at the park and it went directly back to where we stayed.",4.0,"The user visited Shanghai Disney in December and had an overall positive experience, despite the cold weather. The park maintained the expected Disney themes, creating an exciting atmosphere for their children. The family enjoyed the visits, benefiting from the less crowded park, and the user was pleased to be able to go on the ""Soar"" and ""Tron"" rides. They found the food to be good quality and were particularly impressed with the convenience of having a subway station in the park, which had a direct line to their accommodation."
"It is our family’s 5th trip to Shanghai Disneyland. It still amazes me how the cast members were able to make our trip more magical than our last visit!I was very impressed and pleased with the quality of service provided by Catherine (田梦), Mario (restaurant manager) and Xia (引霞) from the Royal Banquet Hall. We appreciate the extra mile they had taken to make our experience memorable and enjoyable.We would like to compliment Gigi (冀宇), Ling (徐玲), Mao (王淼) and Yan (马艳) at Soaring over the Horizon. Their charismatic personalities and friendly disposition instantly made us feel special.Each trip to Shanghai Disneyland is different but the awesome cast members always make us feel at home from the moment we step into Shanghai Disneyland.We are extremely grateful and would like to thank everyone who made our 10 days in Shanghai Disneyland so special and magical!!",5.0,"The reviewer highly praises their 5th trip to Shanghai Disneyland, expressing amazement at how each visit surpasses the last. They are particularly impressed with the exceptional service provided by specific staff members at the Royal Banquet Hall and Soaring over the Horizon. The reviewer appreciates the extra effort made by these staff members to create a memorable, enjoyable experience. They highlight the cast members' friendly nature and their ability to make visitors feel at home. They express immense gratitude for the overall experience during their 10-day stay, highlighting that each trip feels unique and magical."
"We arrived at Disneyland at around 1pm on Christmas Day. There was a short queue to enter the theme park. Queue was well managed and we got into the park in no time.It’s a large park compared to Hong Kong Disneyland. The Shanghai Disney Land smartphone app helped us navigate and see the queue times for each attraction. Would suggest going to the park for two days if you want to experience every ride especially during peak days as certain queues can span over 2hrs.Really enjoyed watching the stage show Eye Of The Storm. As it was raining, the parade was disappointing as it was short with only two floats and all the characters stayed on the floats.",4.0,"The reviewer visited Disneyland on Christmas Day and found it to be more spacious than Hong Kong Disneyland. They appreciated the efficiency of the park, including the queue management. They found the park's smartphone app useful for navigating around and checking waiting times for attractions. They recommend a two-day visit to fully experience all rides, especially during peak times. They enjoyed the stage show Eye Of The Storm, but were disappointed with the parade as it was shortened due to rain, featuring only two floats with characters."
"Good sized park with not as much rides compared to other Disneylands. There’s only 1 daytime parade, but the castle stage show and the light show on castle is good. Even though park is big, you still need to be early to get a good viewing spot.You must download the app to make full use of the experience. Fast pass can be obtained through the app, and popular rides’ fast pass can be gone by early morning due to early park entries by Disney Hotels guests.Must rides are Pirates, Tron, followed by Soaring and Snow White Mine Train (is a remake of Thunder Mountain, with smoother ride). Winnie the Pooh will be a let down if you have done the one in Tokyo.Character photo taking is serious business there and will take a long time. Each party can take multiple poses and individual photos with the characters, so be prepared to wait even if the queue looks short.A good idea to buy a PhotoPass. The official photographers do a good job and even suggest how to pose. You can also get good pics of the meet and greets and rides you take.",4.0,"The user describes the park as large, but with fewer rides than other Disney parks. They were impressed with the castle stage show and the light show. Despite the park's size, it's still necessary to get there early to secure a good viewing spot. The app is essential for acquiring Fast Passes and optimising the experience. Popular rides, such as Pirates, Tron, Soaring, and Snow White Mine Train, quickly run out of Fast Passes. They describe character photo sessions as time-consuming, but worthwhile, and suggest purchasing a PhotoPass for quality photographs. Overall, despite a few downfalls, they enjoyed the experience."
"We’ve been to Disneyland in other countries , this one is not Disneyland it is selfie-land. There’s no Disney magic due to the sheer number of people taking selfies at every angle every square footage of this place- posing in front of a bin, in front of the toilet block , tree , fence, the ground, the railing... it’s no wonder the characters can’t roam around like in other Disneylands, they will be mobbed. Even in December which is low tourist season the rides still take 60-120 mins to queue with fast passes only available for after 5pm - once you make it in the queues and get on a ride your view is obscured by people leaning out with selfie sticks to take their own ride selfies. I was shocked they could hold those selfie sticks even on the faster rides.  The gift shop is worse as people push and shove - not to buy things- but to pose and take selfies with the Disney toys. Save your money , go have a nice meal somewhere or if you really need to go to Disneyland hop over to Hong Kong Disneyland.",2.0,"The reviewer is disappointed with their visit to Disneyland, criticizing visitors' constant photo-taking and lack of Disney magic. They bring attention to the long wait times for rides (60-120 minutes), even in the low season, and the lack of availability for Fast Passes before 5pm. The reviewer is also shocked by people using selfie-sticks on rides, obstructing the view. They found the gift shop overcrowded, with visitors more interested in taking photos with the merchandise than purchasing it. Their overall recommendation is to spend money elsewhere, possibly on a nice meal, or visit Hong Kong Disneyland instead."
"December is a good time visiting Shanghai Disneyland, not a school holiday in mainland so short waiting time in line, I bought fast-passes to enjoy more activities with my kids.",4.0,The user had a positive experience visiting Shanghai Disneyland in December due to shorter waiting times as it was not a school holiday in mainland. They also found purchasing fast-passes beneficial for enjoying more activities with their children.
We had an 8 hour layover at Shanghai airport and decided to get a taxi to Disneyland.The lady at the tourist info desk said this should cost 50 yuan but it cost 100 on the way out. The driver on the way back tried to charge us almost 600 yuan which ended up in a heated argument so a word of warning here.The park itself feels large when compared to other Disney parks but the attractions are spread out.We went on a rainy Saturday and managed almost every ride in about 5 hours thanks to the app and the fast pass system. Connect to the WiFi and scan your tickets as soon as you have them to get started. Highlights for us were the Tron lightcycles and Pirates of the Caribbean which has had a significant upgrade from it’s US counterpart.Order your tickets online in advance for coupons for free food. You will need We Chat on your phone for this though so download in advance if possible.,4.0,"The user had an overall mixed experience during their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai. They were caught off guard by the high taxi fares from the airport to Disneyland and recommend caution. They found the park sizeable with attractions spread rather sparsely. Despite visiting on a rainy day, they could enjoy most rides in about five hours due to the fast pass system and an app. The user recommends connecting to the WiFi and scanning the tickets as soon as possible. They enjoyed the Tron lightcycles and an upgraded Pirates of the Caribbean ride. They also suggest ordering tickets online in advance for free food coupons, but note that this requires the WeChat app, which should be downloaded beforehand."
"We were at Disneyland for two days and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Seems like a good time to come if you do not mind the mild cold because the queues are short. Went on a Thursday and the queue for the rides were only 5-10 minutes, with the exception of Tron, Seven Dwarves and Soaring Over the Horizon. Even managed to get three fast passes! Went again on a Friday and queues were significantly longer, with queues at Soaring at about two hours. My recommendation is to come Monday to Thursday to maximise the number of rides. Overall, December seems like a good time to come as it is not the school holidays. There is no need for VIP tours or premier access passes for sure during this period.Compared the last time I was here in 2017, the security checks were very fast and staff were well-trained and polite. English proficiency seems to have improved as well. There were many previous reviews about queue-cutting behaviour - but they are far and few between during our two days here.Had several meals at Disneytown - Blue Frog, Ippudo, Wolfgang Puck - and they were all rather affordable. I think they are of much better value and quality compared to the prices in the park itself.Will definitely be back again!",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their two-day trip to Disneyland, especially because going in December meant shorter queue times. They suggested visiting from Monday to Thursday for the shortest queues. The reviewer noted improvements in the staff's efficiency and English proficiency compared to a previous visit in 2017. They didn't experience much queue-cutting and didn't find VIP tours or premier passes necessary during their visit. They ate at several places in Disneytown, endorsing the food for its value and quality compared to in-park food outlets. They plan on returning to Disneyland."
"If you are looking for vegan food the Tangled Tavern sell a sweet and sour vegetable dish with rice for 90RMB. I believe it was vegan and it was absolutely delicious. I forgot to take a photo because I ate it too fast!! It came with a free Frozen Olaf icey pole and a drink.I’ve forgotten what it was called but the Marvel themed diner next to the Tron ride had a veggie burger with a green bun. Again, unsure but i believe it was vegan, it was very hard to understand due to the very little english the staff spoke. The bun was very dry and the burger was lacking sauce. The pattie was like a beyond burger crossed with a veggie pattie has it had diced veggies throughout. it was about $20 AUD so quite expensive ! it also came with chips and a free icey pole and drink. wouldn’t normally recommend it but they isn’t really another option :’(i did see fruit cups in a few of the themed restaurants. I would recommend to bring in your own food/snacks as they don’t really check your bags.",4.0,"The reviewer enjoyed the sweet and sour vegetable dish from the Tangled Tavern, considering it a delicious vegan option. However, they had an unpleasant experience with the veggie burger at a Marvel-themed diner, citing a dry green bun, lack of sauce, and high price, even though it came with chips, an icy pole, and a drink. They noted the staff's limited English skills, making the food situation slightly hard to understand. Additionally, they saw fruit cups in some theme restaurants and advised bringing personal food/snacks due to lack of sufficient vegan options. They also noted that bag checks were not stringent, allowing for outside food to be brought in."
Can't get enough of the Disney Parks around the world.Shanghai is great. The rides are cool (Soarin' and Pirates were my personal highlights) and there's something for everyone. It's very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful.Can't wait to go back!!,5.0,"The review is extremely positive about the Disney Parks, specifically Shanghai. The user enjoys the rides, highlighting Soarin' and Pirates as their favorites and appreciates the variety available. The user also praises the cleanliness of the park and the friendly and helpful nature of the staff. Their experience was good enough to inspire eagerness about returning."
"In this first visit to a Disneyland, I am not impressed. The only star of the trip is tron rollercoaster. The rest is pretty much average. Don’t buy a 2 day pass if u are going at this time. The park is pretty much empty due to the cold and the wet weather, so most of the rides are 5-10min/no queue at all. The park is not as big as I thought, it was spacious, but less attractions than hongkong Disneyland (according to my cousin). We finished all the rides (I’m not kidding) and walking around the park by 4.30pm (we started at 8.30am and no lunch). Very limited food options/mostly local food. Maybe I’m Abit biased about the food cos I’m from Singapore. But if u have kids 8up, 1 day in the park is seriously enough. Don’t waste your money!! I really feel I wasted an extra day. :/",3.0,"The reviewer visited Disneyland for the first time and was not impressed. They found the park average with the exception of the Tron rollercoaster. They advised against purchasing a two-day pass, as they completed all rides and explored the entire park in a single day, partly because it was almost empty due to unfavorable weather conditions. They felt the park had fewer attractions than Hong Kong Disneyland and limited food options, most of which were local dishes, which might not appeal to international travelers. They concluded that it wasn't worth spending a second day and expressed disappointment for doing so."
"There are all kind of facilities to have a great dayYou can enjoy exciting game, you can eat food that saw in the cartoon, there is a veeeery beautiful carnival by disneyland characters.You can spend your time at disneyland even more than one day 😍😍😍",5.0,"The review is very positive, highlighting the various facilities available for a great day at Disneyland. The reviewer mentions exciting games, cartoon-themed food, and a beautiful carnival featuring Disneyland characters. They loved it so much that they suggest it's worth spending more than one day there."
"Get there by metro to save money on transport . In fact the taxi might take longer coz there are jams all the time. The Fastpass is really great especially since it doesnâ€™t cost extra and itâ€™s a fair system. Tron and Pirates are by far the best rides. If you are looking for food, those inside the park are standard fare but there are nicer options in Disney town (Xin Wang)",5.0,"The reviewer suggests using the metro rather than a taxi to reach due to frequent traffic jams. They highly recommend the Fastpass system for rides, particularly enjoying Tron and Pirates. While the food inside the park is standard, they recommend trying better options in Disney town, particularly Xin Wang."
"Much better than Hong Kong Disneyland, much bigger. The best is the Tron ride. It was very exciting as I sat in a motorcycle riding position that brought my body and face forward, quite scary. Overall it was a good time with the kids. The light show in the evening was also nice. Then we had a nice dinner in the Cheesecake Factory!",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience, finding it superior to Hong Kong Disneyland due to its larger size. The Tron ride was a highlight, offering an exciting and slightly scary motorcycle riding simulation. The reviewer also enjoyed time with the kids, an evening light show, and a pleasing dinner at the Cheesecake Factory."
"We visited Disneyland during winter. Itâ€™s not so crowded in which you can entered all rides if you plan well. For the night show, we have waited to see the show and firework at 8pm, unfortunately, there is no firework on that night due to bad air pollution but understandable reason though. So if you would like to see the firework, maybe you need to take air pollution as consideration before as well.",4.0,"The review describes a satisfactory visit to Disneyland during winter, when it was not very crowded and allowed them to enjoy all the rides with proper planning. However, they were disappointed as they couldn't see the fireworks during the night show at 8pm due to air pollution. They suggest that others planning to watch the fireworks should consider the likely air quality."
"If you like Disney you will not be disappointed. This park is pretty awesome with lots of great attractions and, of course, the largest castle. The Enchanted Storybook Castle is huge and looms over 197 feet tall over the park.

"We have always like theme parks. This park is big. We stayed at Disneyland hotel and had early access, which is great because we manage to go on a few rides without queue and also manage to book fastpasses without much effort (although we did need to figure out how to book for a while but the app is friendly enough, just that wifi connection in china is a pain).My older child enjoyed herself very much. My younger one (3yo) tired easily, so it is a good thing we can pop back and forth the hotel.Great firework at the end.",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their visit to the theme park, particularly benefiting from staying at the Disneyland hotel, which allowed for early access and easier booking of fastpasses.
