"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters.

The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, describing it as the best one they have visited worldwide.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."
"Quite underwhelmed. My mam and dad wanted to go during their visit to China because they had never been to Disney land. Me and my wife were reluctant as our baby is 1.4 yrs old, and wondered who it would really be for, cause it ainâ€™t for us. They insisted it would be fun and even the baby would love it.I was reluctant but I thought, well itâ€™s supposed to be world class isnâ€™t it. Even if the queues for the rides are preposterously long, they must have sufficient entertainment for even the adults I guess. Wrong. Aside from the morning parade which was legit cool, the rest was just rides and visual things to look at, or super expressive consumerist experiences in the shops. The rides are not even that special or enticing to me, Iâ€™ve been in a few theme parks and even the just ok rides would have you waiting an hour to an hour and a half. Thatâ€™s about a third or a quarter of the time youâ€™d spend out and about, after you omit your meals. Just bad value.I really thought thereâ€™d be magical entertainment all over, like how in the fringe fest in Edinburgh, when you walk around thereâ€™s street acts and an electric vibe. Nothing really here though except walking around at the impressive areas they created. Although those areas are visually impressive, the main thing to do it seems is go to the rides. But the wait makes it impractical and miserable. Unless you wanna go on the equivalent to the teacupsâ€¦ then good for you only 20m wait.People spend a lot of time waiting to queue just for a photo with a character. We waited half an hour just to get the baby in a photo with Mickey Mouse and I just thought this is all just a big charade isnâ€™t it. I mean why not just have a few Mickey Mouseâ€™s and other big characters wondering round the park? Why just have one and make a big deal of this mere photo opportunity, put him in a big special building for this purpose and then make you wait all that time. Why so orchestrated?I thought I might see some tricks and fun things in the streets as I walked around but I didnâ€™t. I think sometimes people pay a lot for things and then become invested so they say things were good cause they donâ€™t wanna admit they wasted money on a bad idea or that the ideas they have for passing time are actually rubbish ðŸ˜‚Finally, I didnâ€™t see anything that was very entertaining for such young babies. Like a baby play area or anything like that. It may be a bit much to expect them to cater in this regard but, who are they catering to currently? I didnâ€™t feel like it was me, and it wasnâ€™t for the babyâ€¦ so just kids? Well it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Put on more entertainment, shows, street tricks, activities",2.0,"The reviewer was disappointed with their visit to Disneyland in China. They found the entertainment to be insufficient, with long queues incompatible with the value delivered by the rides. They were expecting more of an electric vibe with street acts and found the focus mainly on rides that involved substantial waiting times. The reviewer also criticized the orchestrated photo opportunity with characters like Mickey Mouse which also involved a lengthy wait, suggesting that characters should roam around the park instead. They also mentioned a lack of facilities for very young children and suggested Disneyland should diversify its entertainment to cater beyond just kids."
"Rubbish customer service, brought the wrong size at closing time rushing for the last train at night. Went back next day to exchange and was told by a member of staff I had to buy the correct size then go to the refund desk to get a refund. After the queuing up got to told I can't refund it as I had got free gifts when I had originally purchased a lot of items the day before and to get a refund I would have to give them the gifts back. All I wanted was to change the item to correct size. Supervisor came out and started to raise her voice and told me to go find her colleague who told us we could do this. Bare in mind this place is huge. She then shoved the back of the receipt in my face and shouted at us ( we have 3 kids, in Disneyland) saying it's in Chinese and English in her broken English. I had to walk out really frustrated and angry. The lack of customer relations is ridiculous, they are definitely better Disney parks than this one. We weren't trying to con them, al I wanted was the correct size for my son. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1.0,"The review is overall negative, expressing frustration with the customer service. The reviewer bought the wrong size item in a hurry and tried to exchange it the next day, but was told they would have to buy the correct size first and then get a refund. They also encountered issues with a free gift that came with the original purchase, which the store wanted back in order to process the refund. The reviewer found the staff to be unhelpful and rude, especially a supervisor who raised her voice and was difficult to understand. The reviewer also mentioned the size of the store as an issue, felt wronged, and warns future customers to avoid this Disneyland store."
"I was super thrilled to see the first time Disneyland. It is really huge  and have variety of attractions. However, waiting for one ride can take from 1-2 hours. All day i had only 6-7 rides, when i could have more than that. Food is also little pricey. However, I enjoyed walking around and to be spectator of wonderful fireworks.",4.0,"The reviewer expressed great excitement about their first visit to Disneyland, praising its sizable area and diverse attractions. However, they were disappointed by the long waiting times for rides (1-2 hours), which resulted in them only experiencing 6-7 attractions throughout the day. They also commented that food prices were high. Despite these issues, they enjoyed strolling around the park and watching the impressive fireworks display."
"overall the experience was good. lets start from the advantages, the staff member was polite, we had a lot of fun there. but it's not recommended with no fast pass, especially the ones who wanna play the popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster (we bought one), if you wanna get to play all rides or at least half of them, a fast pass could help a lot. the average queue time for a ride could take an hour or more. Since we went in Wednesday there's not a lot of people, but sure there might be MASSVE amount of people in the summer break or other holidays.",4.0,"The reviewer had a good overall experience. They praised the polite staff and enjoyed the fun atmosphere. However, they do not recommend visiting without a fast pass, especially for popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster. To enjoy all or at least half of the rides, a fast pass is advised. The average waiting time for rides can exceed an hour. The reviewer visited on a Wednesday when it was less crowded but expects it could be extremely busy during summer breaks or holidays."
We came here straight after Paris Disney which we rated highly. Sadly July is a no to visit this place. It was local school holidays and we went on a Monday. The heat and lack of shade and indoor eating areas did us in. The lines and entrance confusion was a bad start but then the absence of shade in 39 degree heat was a no go. We did two rides and had to leave when we lined up for 40 minutes just to get into a place to eat only to then have to search for a table - after looking for a table for 20 minutes we headed home.,2.0,"The reviewer had a disappointing experience visiting an unspecified location in July, during local school holidays. The place was extremely crowded and the entry process was confusing. There was a lack of indoor eating areas and shade, which made the visit uncomfortable in the 39-degree heat. Long queuing times, both for rides and restaurants, made the experience even worse and led to them leaving early."
"The walk to the entrance if by tour bus is half an hour. Once you get to the gate area, there's so many zigzag barriers that even on a not so busy day, you have to walk round and round on what otherwise would only be a few steps without the barriers.This is the first Disneyland I've been to where you're allowed to bring in food.Rides and queues inside are otherwise orderly.  I only saw 3 people spitting on the ground (I was expecting more).  A few people were smoking outside the designated smoking areas.We spent 2 days here.  This can actually be experienced in a day.",4.0,"The reviewer highlights that getting to the park's entrance can be a bit lengthy if traveling by tour bus, taking around half an hour. The park's entrance layout includes many zigzag barriers which add unnecessary distance, even on quieter days. They also mention that contrary to other Disneyland locations, you can bring in your own food. Rides and queues are organized and relatively clean, with only a few instances of inappropriate behavior like spitting and smoking observed. Despite spending 2 days, the reviewer believes that the park can be fully experienced within a single day."
A below average Disneyland experience despite excellent hardware. I had fast pass to save time but still felt like I was a semi-finished good in a conveyance belt. My feeling is that 50% of the staffs didnâ€™t make guests feel welcoming and 70% has no smile on their face.Personally I disliked most is smoking. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see people smoking in non-smoking areas and the staffs appeared that they didnâ€™t care. This is extremely disturbing for a non-smoker like myself,3.0,"The reviewer had an unsatisfying experience at Disneyland, despite using a fast pass to expedite queue times. They found the staff unwelcoming, with a majority not smiling or engaging positively with guests. The reviewer was also annoyed by the widespread smoking in non-smoking areas, which was not addressed by staff, creating an uncomfortable environment for them as a non-smoker."
"It was rainy, hot, and humid so I wouldn't recommend going in June. BUT the air conditioning was excellent once you got into buildings. The Zootopia area is incredible and so cute! I also loved the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show. So amazing! This is a wonderful park. Loved it!",5.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience due to rainy, hot and humid weather in June, however, they enjoyed the excellent air conditioning inside the buildings.

Good  but was quite disappointed with the handling of the queues for the shows by the staff and the waiting period was terrible. People were cutting lies trying to go over you and the entertainment shows were hardly 15 minutes. I would give it an average and Please note that seating areas to rest yourself are very limited. During peak hours it's a really killer. Dining was average to but there was a really good pastry shop in mickeys downtown. There were too many characters as well.  Shopping was excellent bur crowd control could be managed better.,3.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience. They were disappointed with the handling of queues for shows and the long waiting periods, expressing dissatisfaction with the short duration of entertainment shows.

They appreciated the shopping experience but felt crowd control could have been better managed. Overall, they rated the experience as average."
"Get harassed by all the illegal toads right infront of the Disney entrance, inside Disney and upon exit to try sell you all toys, service,etc. Super irritating.The working Crew are a huge turn off during our entry and during the games. Most of the staffs mostly dont live up to Disney name. They are rude and unhelpful. If you speak foreign lauggage here then good luck to you..I keep seing people either fight, quarrel or police came to escort people out from the park. Disaster.... this will be my first and last to visit the Shanghai Disney. Will not recommend anyone here unless you just wanna come here for Instagram than to enjoy a real theme park ride.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience at Shanghai Disney due to aggressive vendors outside and inside the entrance.

"Hello everyone! I recently had the chance to visit Shanghai Disneyland on October 17, 2024. I arrived at the park at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until the fireworks ended. I spent the day capturing photos, watching shows, and enjoying the rides. Follow along for the details!PreparationBefore heading to the park, I downloaded the Shanghai Disney Resort app, which offers options to purchase tickets, Early Park Entry Pass, Disney Premier Access, Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass, and Personalized Magical Photo Session, with payments accepted via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and international cards.I discovered the Personalized Magical Photo Session on the app, which appealed to me as a photography enthusiast. I wanted beautiful photos to post on social media, so I booked a session (bookings must be made at least one day in advance). The cost was ¥700, but due to issues with my travel card, I had to pay via Alipay with a 3% surcharge, totaling ¥721. The private photographer follows you for 90 minutes, with a maximum of six people per session.In addition to this, there’s also the Disney PhotoPass One Day Pass for ¥288, which allows you to take photos with designated photographers around the park and download ride photos.I also checked the show schedule and selected which ones I wanted to see, as showtimes are fixed. I chose Mickey’s Storybook Adventure, Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Mickey’s Storybook Express, and ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime Celebration.Then I looked through the menu for dining options and chose Mickey & Pals Market Café, Barbossa’s Bounty, and Zootopia Market.Finally, I checked the wait times for rides on the app to decide if purchasing Disney Premier Access would be worthwhile.The VisitI arrived at the parking lot and walked about 20 minutes to the park entrance. There’s a Mickey fountain at the entrance. Security checks are similar to other Disney parks; selfie sticks and tripods are prohibited and must be left in lockers, while food and drinks are generally allowed.Entering the park is unique here—you scan your passport, which also serves as your park ticket. You’ll receive a paper ticket with a QR code for reservations, like the Standby Pass for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure. I reserved the 11:40 a.m. show.After entering, I visited Carefree Corner to confirm my Personalized Magical Photo Session, choosing the 4:00 p.m. slot. I then stopped by Avenue M Arcade to buy some Mickey ears for photos and queued up for Mickey’s Storybook Adventure at 10:40 a.m.ShowsMickey’s Storybook AdventureThis indoor show takes you through Disney stories with 23 characters. Mickey and Goofy discover a magic book, encountering Olaf, Baloo, King Louie, Moana, Mulan, and others along the way, with live music mainly in Chinese and some English songs.Golden Fairytale FanfareAn outdoor show in front of the Enchanted Storybook Castle featuring Snow White, Elsa, Anna, Jasmine, Aladdin, Ariel, Merida, and more, with English songs.Mickey’s Storybook ExpressA 14-minute character parade with numerous Disney favorites.ILLUMINATE! A Nighttime CelebrationA projection mapping show at the Enchanted Storybook Castle with fireworks, fountains, lasers, and Disney and Marvel characters.DiningMickey & Pals Market Café•	Ma La Tang Noodle Soup with Prawn and Beef (¥119) + Dumplings (¥30) - Spicy, tongue-tingling soup with beef slices and shrimp.•	Roasted Spring Chicken with Vegetables (¥129) - Sweet, roasted chicken with a tomato-edamame side.Barbossa’s Bounty•	Barbossa Feast for 2 (¥299) - Grilled squid, ribs, and chicken with two servings of rice; overall, it has a sweet flavor.Zootopia Market•	Disney Zootopia Pawpsicle (¥45) - A sweet and tangy fruit popsicle, perfect for a warm day.RidesPirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken TreasureA boat ride through scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean, with forward, backward, and rotating movements. The visuals and sound effects are impressive, and there’s a small wave toward the end, but it’s not intense.Seven Dwarfs Mine TrainThis ride has a single rider lane, but wait times are similar to the main queue (~1 hour). I bought Disney Premier Access for ¥180, which saved a lot of time. The train takes you through the dwarves’ mine, providing mild thrills.Soaring Over the HorizonSimilar to Disney World and DisneySea, this flight simulation ride takes you over global landmarks with scents like grass and ocean waves for an immersive experience.TRON Lightcycle Power RunExperience riding a TRON motorcycle. You lean forward on the bike and hold onto handlebars, speeding along a thrilling track that’s still accessible for younger guests.Zootopia: Hot PursuitA trackless ride where you pursue runaway sheep from Zootopia. It’s fun, and the single rider line is very short, so I didn’t need to wait.Photo SessionAfter the parade at 3:30 p.m., I headed to Carefree Corner for my photo session. The photographer spoke Chinese, so I used Google Translate to communicate. I requested locations like Gardens of Imagination, Castle Area, Castle Balcony, and Zootopia, and we took photos throughout. With 30 minutes left, I requested to visit Treasure Cove. We wrapped up the session with 100 photos, which were available for download that evening. Note: photos must be downloaded within 90 days, or they’re deleted automatically.Overall, my day at Shanghai Disneyland was filled with memorable shows, tasty food, thrilling rides, and unique photo ops.",5.0,"The user visited Shanghai Disneyland and had a highly detailed and immersive experience.

"We have been to almost all Disneyland around the world and we can say that this is the only one which we enjoyed the most. We went there in mid October and it was amazing. The weather was good and it's not crowded at all during non-peak season. Disneyland Tokyo on the other hand is busy all year round.The park is clean and very well-maintained. Food and the souvenirs are so much cheaper as compared to the rest of the Disneyland. We were spoilt for choices with the wide selection of restaurants and cafes in Disneyland Village. The staff are friendly and most importantly, it's very safe. We can just leave our strollers at ease in the park.The park itself is of a great size and most of the rides are suitable for preschoolers. My daughter is 3 years old (less than 100cm) and there are still quite a few rides she can enjoy. On the other hand, my son who is 5 (110cm), can enjoy most of the rides. He was unable to access a few due to height restrictions.One day pass to Disneyland with DPA is doable during NON-PEAK season but I will still advise a two day pass for a more enjoyable experience.  We checked into the Toy Story Hotel the day before, which is of close proximity to the park so we can start the next day fresh at Disneyland. Staying at Toy Story Hotel or Disneyland Hotel has it's perks as their customers are able to access the park an hour earlier (7.30am) prior the opening hour (8.30am) but we did not utilise it at all. Just for your information, tickets prices from the hotels are the same as those we purchased from Disneyland app. We entered the park at around 11am on the first day and we were still able to complete the DPA (Disney Primer Access) x 11 rides on the first day. For the second day, we just targeted on those rides which we miss out on day one.Most of the rides only took about 15 - 20 minutes without the DPA access, with some of no queue at all. Only a few of the popular rides took about 45 - 60 minutes. We bought the DPA Deluxe Set of 11 before our trip. With this DPA set, we had a special entrance which led us right in front of the castle for the night illumination show, which we enjoyed a lot. It is a must watch at every Disneyland especially in Shanghai. In addition, I will also recommend Zootopia land as is one of our favourites! Overall, this is one of the best Disneyland experience we had. Highly recommended for everyone. :)",5.0,"The reviewer highly recommends this Disneyland location, describing it as the best one they have visited worldwide. They enjoyed the lack of crowds in mid-October and the cleanliness and maintenance of the park. The reviewer appreciated the value of the food and souvenirs and the diverse selection at various cafes and restaurants. They also noted the friendly staff and felt safe leaving their belongings around the park. They were pleased that the park's rides were suitable for their young children, although noted some height restrictions. The Toy Story Hotel, closely located to Disneyland was a convenient place to stay, offering early access benefits.

"I was super excited to visit Disneyland in Shanghai, and we changed our trip to stay in Shanghai for a couple days just to come see this place. As huge Disney fans and regulars at Disneyland in LA and disney world in florida, this would be a new experience. Ooph. What a mistake. We paid for the dream day package spending about 1200 us dollars on tickets to get fast passes. The people were rude and pushed you everywhere you went. People blatantly cut in lines. Tron ride had issues and I had to leave after already using my fast pass. They apologized and gave a coupon for use in the store. When trying to use said coupon it had a bunch of limitations and we ended up waiting in a huge line (I mean the lines in the stores put the US Disney to shame). Turned out the wait was for nothing. The rides were mostly geared towards kids despite almost no children being there. The fast pass system itself was more confusing than the US version (very impressive). I wish I could get a refund, I won't be back. If you're from the States, do yourself a favor. Go see the great wall instead. Avoid our mistake.",1.0,"The reviewer had high expectations for their visit to Disneyland in Shanghai, having adjusted their travel plans specifically to visit there. They are frequent visitors to Disneyland in LA and Disney World in Florida, and were eager to experience Shanghai's version. Unfortunately, the visit was a major disappointment for them. They noted issues like rude people, line-cutting, a malfunctioning ride and a confusing fast pass system. They spent $1200 on tickets for the ""dream day"" package but felt it wasn't worth it. They also received a coupon after a ride problem, but found it was full of limitations and led to a long wait. They observed the park was more child-oriented despite the absence of many kids, and the queues were even longer than those seen at"
"Shanghai Disneyland gave the best experience ever! So many different zones, themed rides, merch and food! Gave me such a good experience to never forget. The only thing was that the items were a bit on the expensive side because of copyright.",5.0,"The reviewer had an unforgettable experience at Shanghai Disneyland, praising its various themed zones, rides, merchandise, and food. However, they noted that the items were somewhat expensive due to copyright issues."
"We just had a fantastic day at Shanghai Disneyland with my wife and two kids, and while the experience was magical, there are definitely a few things you should know before you go!First off, I highly recommend getting the priority passes. The park is insanely popular in China, and if you visit on a weekend or public holiday, you’ll be in line for what feels like forever. Trust me, avoid those peak times if you can—it gets seriously packed.Before heading in, download the app. It’s super helpful for checking wait times, finding your way around, and even booking rides. Also, don't forget to bring your passport—you’ll need it to get your tickets. A big tip: bring a few water bottles. There are refill stations, which is a nice perk, and it helps save you from buying overpriced drinks. One more thing—bring some dry clothes! Some of the rides can get you wet, and being soggy for the rest of the day isn't fun.As for the rides, we loved the Tron roller coaster—it’s crazy fast and futuristic. The new Zootopia ride was also a huge hit with the kids. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics, and the laser light show with fireworks was a great finale.Overall, we had a blast. Just plan ahead, go on a quieter day, and make sure you’re prepared with these little tips. Highly recommend it for families!",5.0,"The user had a wonderful experience at Shanghai Disneyland with their family. They heavily recommend getting priority passes due to the park's popularity causing long lines especially during weekends and public holidays. The use of the park's app for navigation and ride bookings, as well as bringing a passport, water bottles, and dry clothes, were beneficial tips given. They enjoyed the Tron roller coaster, Zootopia ride, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and found the laser light show with fireworks a great end to the day. They highly recommend the park for families but suggest planning ahead and visiting on quieter days."
"WHEN:Visited on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays.Still crowded, but a lot better than during summer holidays itself.Thought it was weird that it was still very hot for the start of fall, but thankful that we didn't get caught in the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 70 years just a week later!ZOOTOPIA:Shanghai Disneyland is the first in the world to get this land opened in 2023 while the rest of the world gotta wait till 2025 for it. They built almost the exact replica of what you see in the movies - super cute to see the tall, tall giraffes working out alongside the lemmings spinning their balls to work in the hamster tubes. The various zones of Tundratown (freezing!), Sahara Square (with fake camel ""Gurlzelle""), Rainforest District's gondolas and even a ""Tiger NightClub"" were portrayed extremely well in both the land and its immersive rides!RIDES:For those who'd been to other Disneylands, the most unique here are Zootopia's ""Hot Pursuit"" and Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle, since they are both unavailable in any other Disneylands. Pirates of the Caribbean in most other Disneylands are getting a little boring with short queues, but you'll find the one here WAY cooler because of its much newer technology. Camp Discovery is unique because it ain't a ride, it's an obstacle course where you get to ""climb"" up/through some rock/cave/waterfall of Adventure Isle while being harnessed and tethered. The most underwhelming was Pooh's ride which was a lot shorter and two-dimensional than the one we rode at other Disneylands.SHOWS:Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best if you fancy some choreographed stunts and  acrobatics; Elsa's still the perennial favourite and Stitch Encounter was funny for both kids and adults, but you gotta understand Mandarin.DPAs/single Riders/walking/Meet&Greet:- Disney Premier Access are available individually, but also in sets. We got all:DPA Inspiration set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA Adventure set of SIX rides @ 815rmbDPA FOUR shows (Pirates, Elsa, Storybook, Adventure Rhythm NEW) @ 720rmbThat's the only way to finish most rides and shows in one day @ ~320usd/pax.- When we saw some single rider queues @ 40 minutes, we knew the DPA was worth it.- If you flew many hours to get here, it's probably worth it to pay 320usd more to NOT queue and jostle, and mostly, to be kind to your legs because this park is HUGE!- There was no time for Meet&Greet if you want to finish all rides & shows in a day. Also, we honestly found those at Hong Kong Disneyland nicer and MORE available.SPECIAL NOTES for DPA:- Definitely need your phone to scan TWICE for every DPA entry;- Some rides' DPA don't go all the way to the ride, still gotta join last bits of the queue (perhaps that's how you still can appreciate some of the decor at the queue?);- DPAs for shows means they let you in 15 minutes before show starts. They'll let everyone else in 10 minutes before show starts. DO NOT MAKE OUR SAME MISTAKE by booking two shows back to back... you might just miss the DPA of your next show if you do not arrive early enough. They don't do seat reservations here for DPA-holders like in Tokyo Disneyland.COMPARING TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BEIJING:- We visited Universal Studios in Beijing next since it's only a three-hour flight away.- While Disney magic and their unforgettable characters are priceless, and one could tell that a lot more effort went into their overall decor, shows and even service...- Would say we had a much more relaxing and cheaper time at Universal Studios Beijing. They are also newer and have some really cool rides i.e. Jurassic!!",4.0,"The reviewer visited Shanghai Disneyland on the last Sunday of China's summer school holidays. They remarked on the crowds but appreciated missing a significant storm. The new Zootopia area was praised for being a faithful replication of the movie scenes, and the unique rides like 'Hot Pursuit' and 'Tomorrowland's TRON Lightcycle' were highlighted as exclusive attractions. In comparison to other Disneylands, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was noted for its advanced technology. However, Pooh's ride was considered subpar. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was the reviewer's favorite, while Elsa's show remained a classic hit and Stitch Encounter appealed to both kids and adults, provided one understands Mandarin. They highly recommended the Disney Premier Access (DPA) passes"
We was pleasantly surprised at this Disney park. The ticket prices were fairly reasonable for Disney and we went during a quieter period which meant was easy to go on rides with no queues! Actually managed to go on Tron multiple times. The pirates of the Caribbean ride was also one of the best we have seen and there is also a new Zootopia area. They had multiple parades throughout the day which all the popular character were in. Food here was fairly average and highly priced. The fireworks here was one of the best of any Disney parks especially the Marvel section. (Must see!),5.0,"The user had a positive experience at the Disney park, appreciating the reasonable ticket prices and the fact that going during a quieter period let them enjoy multiple rides without waiting in lines. They especially liked the Tron ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and mentioned the addition of a new Zootopia section. The park had numerous parades featuring popular characters throughout the day. The user found the food to be average and pricey. However, they were very impressed with the fireworks, particularly the Marvel segment, which they highly recommend."
"Crowdonly able to squeeze into 2-3 ride, a pity but the experience was perfect.The serviceGreat service as usual. The staff was patient. They even gave us some sticker, which were so cute! (see photos)Food and snackThe snack was delicious but overpriced and portion was a small. The food in the restaurant were not very ok, however, very expensive.A pityThere were many people in the Zootopia. Not a chance to go there at all.",4.0,"The review expresses satisfaction with the overall experience and excellent service, including patient staff and cute free stickers. However, the reviewer felt the snacks were tasty but overpriced and small in portion. They found the food in the restaurant mediocre and too expensive. They also noted disappointment about the crowd at Zootopia, which prevented them from visiting."
"Quite underwhelmed. My mam and dad wanted to go during their visit to China because they had never been to Disney land. Me and my wife were reluctant as our baby is 1.4 yrs old, and wondered who it would really be for, cause it ainâ€™t for us. They insisted it would be fun and even the baby would love it.I was reluctant but I thought, well itâ€™s supposed to be world class isnâ€™t it. Even if the queues for the rides are preposterously long, they must have sufficient entertainment for even the adults I guess. Wrong. Aside from the morning parade which was legit cool, the rest was just rides and visual things to look at, or super expressive consumerist experiences in the shops. The rides are not even that special or enticing to me, Iâ€™ve been in a few theme parks and even the just ok rides would have you waiting an hour to an hour and a half. Thatâ€™s about a third or a quarter of the time youâ€™d spend out and about, after you omit your meals. Just bad value.I really thought thereâ€™d be magical entertainment all over, like how in the fringe fest in Edinburgh, when you walk around thereâ€™s street acts and an electric vibe. Nothing really here though except walking around at the impressive areas they created. Although those areas are visually impressive, the main thing to do it seems is go to the rides. But the wait makes it impractical and miserable. Unless you wanna go on the equivalent to the teacupsâ€¦ then good for you only 20m wait.People spend a lot of time waiting to queue just for a photo with a character. We waited half an hour just to get the baby in a photo with Mickey Mouse and I just thought this is all just a big charade isnâ€™t it. I mean why not just have a few Mickey Mouseâ€™s and other big characters wondering round the park? Why just have one and make a big deal of this mere photo opportunity, put him in a big special building for this purpose and then make you wait all that time. Why so orchestrated?I thought I might see some tricks and fun things in the streets as I walked around but I didnâ€™t. I think sometimes people pay a lot for things and then become invested so they say things were good cause they donâ€™t wanna admit they wasted money on a bad idea or that the ideas they have for passing time are actually rubbish ðŸ˜‚Finally, I didnâ€™t see anything that was very entertaining for such young babies. Like a baby play area or anything like that. It may be a bit much to expect them to cater in this regard but, who are they catering to currently? I didnâ€™t feel like it was me, and it wasnâ€™t for the babyâ€¦ so just kids? Well it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Put on more entertainment, shows, street tricks, activities",2.0,"The reviewer was disappointed with their visit to Disneyland in China. They found the entertainment to be insufficient, with long queues incompatible with the value delivered by the rides. They were expecting more of an electric vibe with street acts and found the focus mainly on rides that involved substantial waiting times. The reviewer also criticized the orchestrated photo opportunity with characters like Mickey Mouse which also involved a lengthy wait, suggesting that characters should roam around the park instead. They also mentioned a lack of facilities for very young children and suggested Disneyland should diversify its entertainment to cater beyond just kids."
"Rubbish customer service, brought the wrong size at closing time rushing for the last train at night. Went back next day to exchange and was told by a member of staff I had to buy the correct size then go to the refund desk to get a refund. After the queuing up got to told I can't refund it as I had got free gifts when I had originally purchased a lot of items the day before and to get a refund I would have to give them the gifts back. All I wanted was to change the item to correct size. Supervisor came out and started to raise her voice and told me to go find her colleague who told us we could do this. Bare in mind this place is huge. She then shoved the back of the receipt in my face and shouted at us ( we have 3 kids, in Disneyland) saying it's in Chinese and English in her broken English. I had to walk out really frustrated and angry. The lack of customer relations is ridiculous, they are definitely better Disney parks than this one. We weren't trying to con them, al I wanted was the correct size for my son. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1.0,"The review is overall negative, expressing frustration with the customer service. The reviewer bought the wrong size item in a hurry and tried to exchange it the next day, but was told they would have to buy the correct size first and then get a refund. They also encountered issues with a free gift that came with the original purchase, which the store wanted back in order to process the refund. The reviewer found the staff to be unhelpful and rude, especially a supervisor who raised her voice and was difficult to understand. The reviewer also mentioned the size of the store as an issue, felt wronged, and warns future customers to avoid this Disneyland store."
"I was super thrilled to see the first time Disneyland. It is really huge  and have variety of attractions. However, waiting for one ride can take from 1-2 hours. All day i had only 6-7 rides, when i could have more than that. Food is also little pricey. However, I enjoyed walking around and to be spectator of wonderful fireworks.",4.0,"The reviewer expressed great excitement about their first visit to Disneyland, praising its sizable area and diverse attractions. However, they were disappointed by the long waiting times for rides (1-2 hours), which resulted in them only experiencing 6-7 attractions throughout the day. They also commented that food prices were high. Despite these issues, they enjoyed strolling around the park and watching the impressive fireworks display."
"overall the experience was good. lets start from the advantages, the staff member was polite, we had a lot of fun there. but it's not recommended with no fast pass, especially the ones who wanna play the popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster (we bought one), if you wanna get to play all rides or at least half of them, a fast pass could help a lot. the average queue time for a ride could take an hour or more. Since we went in Wednesday there's not a lot of people, but sure there might be MASSVE amount of people in the summer break or other holidays.",4.0,"The reviewer had a good overall experience. They praised the polite staff and enjoyed the fun atmosphere. However, they do not recommend visiting without a fast pass, especially for popular rides like the Tron rollercoaster. To enjoy all or at least half of the rides, a fast pass is advised. The average waiting time for rides can exceed an hour. The reviewer visited on a Wednesday when it was less crowded but expects it could be extremely busy during summer breaks or holidays."
We came here straight after Paris Disney which we rated highly. Sadly July is a no to visit this place. It was local school holidays and we went on a Monday. The heat and lack of shade and indoor eating areas did us in. The lines and entrance confusion was a bad start but then the absence of shade in 39 degree heat was a no go. We did two rides and had to leave when we lined up for 40 minutes just to get into a place to eat only to then have to search for a table - after looking for a table for 20 minutes we headed home.,2.0,"The reviewer had a disappointing experience visiting an unspecified location in July, during local school holidays. The place was extremely crowded and the entry process was confusing. There was a lack of indoor eating areas and shade, which made the visit uncomfortable in the 39-degree heat. Long queuing times, both for rides and restaurants, made the experience even worse and led to them leaving early."
"The walk to the entrance if by tour bus is half an hour. Once you get to the gate area, there's so many zigzag barriers that even on a not so busy day, you have to walk round and round on what otherwise would only be a few steps without the barriers.This is the first Disneyland I've been to where you're allowed to bring in food.Rides and queues inside are otherwise orderly.  I only saw 3 people spitting on the ground (I was expecting more).  A few people were smoking outside the designated smoking areas.We spent 2 days here.  This can actually be experienced in a day.",4.0,"The reviewer highlights that getting to the park's entrance can be a bit lengthy if traveling by tour bus, taking around half an hour. The park's entrance layout includes many zigzag barriers which add unnecessary distance, even on quieter days. They also mention that contrary to other Disneyland locations, you can bring in your own food. Rides and queues are organized and relatively clean, with only a few instances of inappropriate behavior like spitting and smoking observed. Despite spending 2 days, the reviewer believes that the park can be fully experienced within a single day."
A below average Disneyland experience despite excellent hardware. I had fast pass to save time but still felt like I was a semi-finished good in a conveyance belt. My feeling is that 50% of the staffs didnâ€™t make guests feel welcoming and 70% has no smile on their face.Personally I disliked most is smoking. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see people smoking in non-smoking areas and the staffs appeared that they didnâ€™t care. This is extremely disturbing for a non-smoker like myself,3.0,"The reviewer had an unsatisfying experience at Disneyland, despite using a fast pass to expedite queue times. They found the staff unwelcoming, with a majority not smiling or engaging positively with guests. The reviewer was also annoyed by the widespread smoking in non-smoking areas, which was not addressed by staff, creating an uncomfortable environment for them as a non-smoker."
"It was rainy, hot, and humid so I wouldn't recommend going in June. BUT the air conditioning was excellent once you got into buildings. The Zootopia area is incredible and so cute! I also loved the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show. So amazing! This is a wonderful park. Loved it!",5.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience due to rainy, hot and humid weather in June, however, they enjoyed the excellent air conditioning inside the buildings. Highlights included the ""incredible"" Zootopia area, the Jack Sparrow ride and stunt show, which they found amazing. Despite the weather, they considered the park wonderful and loved their visit."
Good  but was quite disappointed with the handling of the queues for the shows by the staff and the waiting period was terrible. People were cutting lies trying to go over you and the entertainment shows were hardly 15 minutes. I would give it an average and Please note that seating areas to rest yourself are very limited. During peak hours it's a really killer. Dining was average to but there was a really good pastry shop in mickeys downtown. There were too many characters as well.  Shopping was excellent bur crowd control could be managed better.,3.0,"The reviewer had a mixed experience. They were disappointed with the handling of queues for shows and the long waiting periods, expressing dissatisfaction with the short duration of entertainment shows. They noted that seating areas were limited especially during peak hours and found dining average. They enjoyed a good pastry shop in Mickey's downtown but felt there were too many characters. They appreciated the shopping experience but felt crowd control could have been better managed. Overall, they rated the experience as average."
"Get harassed by all the illegal toads right infront of the Disney entrance, inside Disney and upon exit to try sell you all toys, service,etc. Super irritating.The working Crew are a huge turn off during our entry and during the games. Most of the staffs mostly dont live up to Disney name. They are rude and unhelpful. If you speak foreign lauggage here then good luck to you..I keep seing people either fight, quarrel or police came to escort people out from the park. Disaster.... this will be my first and last to visit the Shanghai Disney. Will not recommend anyone here unless you just wanna come here for Instagram than to enjoy a real theme park ride.",1.0,"The reviewer had a negative experience at Shanghai Disney due to aggressive vendors outside and inside the entrance. They were disappointed with the staff, who they found to be rude and unhelpful, especially towards those speaking foreign languages. They also noted frequent disturbances, such as fights and police interventions. They would not recommend visiting Shanghai Disney unless it was merely for Instagram photos and not for an enjoyable theme park experience. This was their first and will be their last visit to the park."
"We went on a non holiday week day in June, but the lines are too long. Even to just to get into the park took nearly 40 mins. You can buy speed pass (180 Yuan per person per ride). For a family of 3, you can end up spending a lot of money or wait >1 hour for each ride. Overall I would say it would say it is not worth going. My child had more fun at the Shanghai aquarium.",2.0,"The reviewer visited a park during a non-holiday weekday in June and found the lines extremely long, with a wait time of approximately 40 minutes merely to enter the park. They suggest that while speed passes are available at 180 Yuan per ride, it led to high expenses for their family of three. They found the park not worth the visit, mentioning that their child enjoyed their trip to the Shanghai aquarium more."
"My recent experience at Shanghai Disneyland left me deeply disappointed and frustrated due to several concerning issues that significantly marred what should have been a magical visit.Secondhand Smoke Everywhere: Despite designated smoking zones, the park is overrun with inconsiderate visitors who openly smoke wherever they please, subjecting everyone, especially children, to the dangers of secondhand smoke. This blatant disregard for the rules and lack of courtesy from some Chinese guests made navigating the park a challenge and significantly impacted our enjoyment.Illegal Peddlers: Shockingly, just outside the Disney shops, illegal peddlers openly sell Disney merchandise, directly undermining the integrity of the park's retail experience. It's incomprehensible how Disney allows such activities to persist, tarnishing the authenticity and trust associated with its brand.Annual Pass Holder Abuse: Throughout the park, we encountered aggressive annual pass holders exploiting their privileges to engage in unlawful behavior. These individuals relentlessly pestered guests to purchase Disney merchandise through them, falsely promising discounts and circumventing proper queues. It became evident that they were exploiting their pass holder status to undercut Disney, all in pursuit of personal gain and the advancement of their membership tiers.Overall, my visit to Shanghai Disneyland was marred by these unacceptable issues, detracting from what should have been a magical experience. It's disheartening to witness such blatant disregard for rules and ethics within the confines of a place meant to inspire joy and wonder. I sincerely hope that management takes swift and decisive action to address these issues and uphold the standards of excellence that Disney is known for.",1.0,"The review describes a disappointing and frustrating experience at Shanghai Disneyland due to instances of rule-breaking and unethical behavior. The issues mentioned include rampant smoking outside of designated areas, illegal vendors selling Disney merchandise outside official shops and aggressive annual pass holders exploiting their privileges for personal gain. These situations contributed to a poor visit and the reviewer urges the management to take action."
The park is awesome like all disney parks. But even on a weekday its too tooo tooo crowded. You end up waiting 40 mins for one ride. Try and book fast track if available and just avoid weekends. Access is also easy by metro and car.,4.0,"The reviewer loves the park, noting it's as fantastic as other Disney parks. However, they report that it's extremely crowded even on weekdays, causing long wait times for rides. They suggest booking fast track tickets if possible and avoiding weekends. They also note that the park is easily accessible by metro and car."
"We visited during a Chinese school holiday, which meant it was very crowded and the queues very long. Food and drink was expensive, For example, Â£6.00 for a pineapple flavoured ice cream cone.A bit of a faff organising admission passes and fast passes and you must take your passport.We quite enjoyed the visit and obviously, being Disney there is plenty to see , to do and it is pleasant to walk around. At nighttime the best viewing areas get extremely crowded, so find a good spot early and hang on to it.",4.0,"The reviewer visited during a Chinese school holiday, which resulted in significant crowds and long queues.

However, they advised that the best viewing areas at night get extremely crowded and recommend securing a good spot early."
"We had one day at the Park on a free day during part of a 10 day tour of China.  As this was the only DIsney park in the world I hadn't yet been to, I was very keen to visit, and I wasn't disappointed.We ordered our tickets online the night before, and I was able to easily pay with a foreign (non-Chinese) travel card. (A fellow traveller did have a few issues with their card, but they were eventually able to finalise the transaction). The tickets were then linked to our passports, so it is very important to remember to take your passport with you as this is now your entry ticket.We visited on a weekday in mid November, and arrived just before opening time. Entry was quick and easy (including bag inspections).  A lot of the rides were walk-on with minimal wait times during the morning. It became a bit busier in the afternoon, but was still very manageable. (This was the complete opposite of Tokyo Disneyland a few years ago, which was horrendously overcrowded all three days we were there, during the so-called ""off peak"" time. Never again).The Park was beautiful, clean and easy to navigate.  Our ticket included a free meal and drink, which was great value. I chose spaghetti and meatballs, which was huge and filled me up for the day. The menu prices seemed quite reasonable, especially for a Disney park. We bought the PhotoPass, and had some issues trying to get it to work/download, but the staff in the photo shop were amazingly patient and helpful in getting it to finally work.I was disappointed to discover Pirates of the Caribbean was closed, but it's a great excuse to revisit in the future!",5.0,"The user had a positive experience visiting the Disney park during a one-day break on their 10-day tour of China.

After we waited and argued for more than an hour they just let us enter.?",2.0,The reviewer had a negative experience with the gate staff who initially denied them entry due to ticket issues. They had to wait and argue for over an hour before being allowed in.
"Good:1. Quite a big park with a good variety of rides, performances and F&B outlets; Facilities are good overall.2. F&B doesn't cost an arm and a leg like some other parks.3. Relatively well organised and efficiently run park.Bad:1. Most service staff do not seem motivated to give visitors a good experience, they do not smile and their greetings are monotone; Compared to the other Disney parks in the region, the service level is far behind.2. Security officers behave like thugs, barking at visitors during the night event. I understand the need for crowd control, but I've never seen such unruly behavior even from actual law enforcement officers, much less a bunch of security staff.Conclusion:Great activities and rides only form part of the experience, great service is what truly makes Disneyland a magical experience, Unfortunately this is missing in Shanghai Disneyland.",2.0,"The reviewer praises Shanghai Disneyland for its large size, variety of rides, performances, and food and beverage outlets, as well as reasonable pricing for food and drink. The reviewer also appreciates that the park is well-organized and efficiently run. However, they criticize the staff for lacking motivation, rarely smiling, and offering monotone greetings, which they claim is noticeably worse compared to other Disney parks. They also criticize the security officers for being rude and behaving inappropriately during the night event. The reviewer concludes that while the park offers great activities and rides, the poor service detracts from the overall experience."
"Believe it or not, the max we had to queue for any ride was 20 minutes. That was because we went on a rainy day, and the day before Zootopia opened so that kept the crowds away somewhat we think. Having gone to Paris, Hong Kong and LA, this was probably the best experience we had - ever - just because the queues for any ride was so short!Food was better at Universal Resorts Beijing, but the overall experience here cannot be beat. My kids' favourite ride was Roaring Rapids and Tron - Soaring Over The Horizon also rated quite highly too!",5.0,"The review suggests a highly positive experience at the park, attributing the minimal 20-minutes queue times to rainy weather and a new attraction launch on the following day. Comparing it to previous trips to Paris, Hong Kong, and LA, the user found this visit the best thanks chiefly to short queues. While they considered the food better at Universal Resorts Beijing, the overall experience at this place was unbeatable. The reviewer's kids specifically enjoyed the Roaring Rapids and Tron rides, with Soaring Over The Horizon also earning high praise."
"I loved this park, itâ€™s got that Disney charm but just takes the rides up to the next level.Letâ€™s start with the rides: Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron just take the rides up that notch. Pirates in particular is insane about just how immersive it really is, this isnâ€™t the pirates youâ€™re used to but it just blows your mind as youâ€™re going around.The park is stunning and the theming is beautiful throughout and is topped off by the beautiful castle as itâ€™s centre. Having watched vlogs and seen pictures before visiting, I was a little worried I was going to be disappointed and it wouldnâ€™t have a charm as it was so big; I shouldnâ€™t have been worried at all. The castle is perfect and the area around it is different to other Disneyâ€™s which provides great viewing areas for the nightly shows.My only slight negative is, this park is big! It doesnâ€™t have the same charm in some areas as itâ€™s smaller counterparts. For example, Fantasyland is spread out so doesnâ€™t have the same â€˜villageâ€™ type appearance as others.Also, I canâ€™t wait to see what they do with this park in future. Itâ€™s clearly been built with expansion in mind so look forward to seeing how it matures and progresses.",4.0,"The reviewer highly enjoyed the park and was particularly impressed by its advanced and immersive rides, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron. They appreciated the beautiful surroundings, especially the stunning castle and its surrounding areas, which offer excellent views for nightly shows. While they were initially uncertain about the park's large size, they found that most of it was well-designed and charming. They had minor criticisms about some sections, like Fantasyland, losing a bit of charm due to the park's scale. The reviewer anticipates future expansions, believing that the park was built with room for growth."
"This was our second visit, after our first which was in 2016.The place is still as magical as ever!The rides are awesome, if only the queues were not horrendous. Mind you, we went during the national holiday, so it was to be expected. If you don't mind paying for the express lane, and the queue is above 60 minutes, I'd say it is absolutely worth spending your money to shorten the queue and save yourself from the exhaustion of standing in the queue. If you are up for the thrill, I'd strongly suggest Tron ride at the Tomorrowland.We came on the first day of October and were absolutely delighted to see the wonderful Halloween decorations and souvenirs around the park.The cleanliness of the entire place is top notch, including every toilet we had been, even with the park being so crowded. I am super thankful for all the family toilet they have provided in every toilet, it makes it a breeze to bring a toddler to the park, when it comes to changing their diapers or cleaning the up.Another perk that I love is that we can bring an empty drinking bottle to the park, as there always a drinking fountain/tap to refill our bottle situated nearby the toilets.I am excited and hoping that the new Zootopia Land will be completed and opened soon. We would love to return again one day.",5.0,"The reviewer had a great second visit to the amusement park, noting its magical atmosphere and excellent rides. However, they encountered long queues, especially during the national holiday. They recommended using the express lane to avoid long waits if it's above an hour. The place was clean, even during a crowded day, with family-friendly facilities. They particularly appreciated the option to refill their bottles at numerous drinking fountains. They loved the decorations during their visit on the first day of October, especially the Halloween theme. They eagerly await the opening of the new Zootopia Land and intend to revisit."
"Weâ€™re a couple from the UK and big Disney fans. Weâ€™d booked  holiday to China which ended in Shanghai and we decided to visit Disneyland. I tried doing a bit of research about the place which in the end didnâ€™t prove that helpful. Firstly, downloading the app and buying the tickets online - we downloaded the app whilst in the UK. Tickets were only available/released 10 days to two weeks in advance so donâ€™t worry if your date isnâ€™t showing for a months time. The app was very slow whether in the UK or in China but worked much better in China on a Chinese Wi-Fi. Due to the timings we had to wait until we were in China to book the tickets on the app. Iâ€™d read things about huge queues so opted for one of the premier access (fast pass) packages. It cost us Â£300 for two one day park tickets with six fast passes each. The fast passes were ride specific and there are different options depending on the rides you want. You can also buy individual fast passes. Iâ€™d read about huge queues and didnâ€™t want to rely on free fast passes that we might not get so thatâ€™s why I opted for the package. We also bought a one day PhotoPass for around Â£25. Once youâ€™ve bought the tickets in the app itâ€™ll say youâ€™ll get a text and email confirmation for the purchase but I got neither but had took screen shots just in case. The purchase will appear on your app, go to the â€˜meâ€™ section at the bottom where youâ€™ll have to fill in the guest names and passport numbers of the guests for each ticket. YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PASSPORTS WITH YOU. All tickets in China seem to be attached to your passports for security reasons and you wonâ€™t be let in without your passports. They will then give you a paper ticket once at the turnstile at the entrance to the park and you wonâ€™t need your passports again. The PhotoPass is a coupon on the app that youâ€™ll need to get redeemed in the park at one of several locations, it tells you where in the app but we went to cosy corner, itâ€™s the first shop on your right on Mickey Avenue (what would normally be Main Street USA). Youâ€™ll need to download the Disney PhotoPass app too which is where your photos will appear, the cast members will help you and show you. Regardless of whether youâ€™ve had the pass activated, the first time you get to a photographer youâ€™ll be given a card with a QR code on which will be scanned like your band would be in Orlando, every time they take a photo and all photos will appear on the app. You can purchase individual prints of photos at the park or you can have them digitally by buying the PhotoPass. It shows you the photo opportunities on the map of the park in the app. When we went there was no paper map, itâ€™s all on the app. We went on Saturday 16 September which was after the school holidays. Despite it being a Saturday it wasnâ€™t too busy. The longest queue time was 60mins for the seven dwarves mine train which we had a fast pass for. Tron had a 30 minute wait time and so we queued once for it and used the fast pass the next time. Pirates of the Caribbean had a 15 minute wait time so we queued and did that twice too. We got straight on the crystal grotto and queued half an hour for Peter Pan. We went to the Pirates of the Caribbean stunt show which isnâ€™t in English but was still worth seeing (bear with it). Meeting characters has longer wait times for 40-60 minutes, which we didnâ€™t bother with. Another thing to add, no commentary is in English on any of the rides. The parade does have English bits mainly due to the songs, same with the nighttime illuminations at the castle. The park in general is bigger than I thought, I thought it would be on a par with Paris but it was bigger. It has five (I think) lands to it, each has a guest services which have a board up telling you show times etc. Thereâ€™s plenty of western style food, we had pizza from the Pinocchio tavern and we saw burgers in the restaurant in Tomorrowland. Thereâ€™s free water fountains throughout the park and the water tastes normal (not like the matchstick flavoured water of Orlando). Disneytown is the food and shopping area (like a mini Disney Springs) and has the only Starbucks in the park (which doesnâ€™t do anything Disney themed) but is big with indoor and outdoor seating. It is on the side of the park as if another land but you have to pass through security to get in and out of the park, the queue was minimal on the day we went. Itâ€™s hot and humid so prepare for this, my hair turned wild and my Disney themed T-shirt was stuck to me from the moment we arrived. Drink plenty of water. You can pay with credit/debit card at the bigger outlets and restaurants. I had downloaded Alipay but it only works with an internet connection. There is free Wi-Fi in the park which works nicely. Take a power bank! There are ones you can borrow for free in the park that you pay a refundable deposit for through Alipay or similar, however, you have to attach a phone number and it wouldnâ€™t work for us. It appeared you needed a Chinese mobile number. The cast members donâ€™t speak a lot of English but will use a translate app and are very willing to help you. Yeh toilets are very clean with plenty of western style toilets and loo roll (not a given as standard in China). Itâ€™s definitely worth a visit, we loved it. My only complaint, there werenâ€™t any Christmas decorations for sale due to it not being Christmas.",4.0,"This UK couple had a positive experience with their visit to Shanghai Disneyland while on a trip to China. They used the official app to book tickets and fast passes, though they found it to be slow. They had to wait until they were physically in China to buy tickets due to scheduling restrictions. They also purchased a one-day PhotoPass, which allowed them to document their experiences in the park. Despite language barriers, they found the staff and services accommodating. They enjoyed the attractions and were impressed with the cleanliness of the park as well as the availability of western style food. Their only complaint was the lack of Christmas decorations for purchase due to it not being the holiday season. Despite minor difficulties with app speeds and ride commentaries not being in English, they found"
"The worst theme park is Disneyland. I cannot express my negative feelings. Firstly, you walk about 2 kilometers from the taxi collection point to the theme park gate. Secondly, it was very crowded. Thirdly, it was extremely hot and humid. Fourthly, filming with the characters was crowded for about an hour. Fifthly, there is no organization or map in English regarding show times. Sixth, all the rides were crowded. Seventh, the services. Disney ice cream or sweets taste very bad, not delicious, like Disney Orlando, Disney Hong Kong, or Disney Japan. Eighth, I did not encounter any employee at Shanghai Disney, whether in the hallways or at the rides, who spoke English, German, or Spanish. For me it was a waste of time and money",1.0,"The reviewer had a highly negative experience at Disneyland, citing several issues. They found the distance from the taxi point to the park gate excessive and noted that the park was crowded and uncomfortably hot and humid. Wait times to interact with characters were long and the reviewer criticized a lack of English resources for show times and busyness of the rides. The reviewer was also disappointed with the quality of food, specifically ice cream and sweets, and the lack of multilingual staff. They concluded that their visit was a waste of time and money."
"We decided to go for visiting Shanghai Disney in order to celebrate the 50th birthday of one of the participants - the main challenge in the theme park are the long waiting queues - on the Monday we visited (one day ahead of local Summer vacation over), waiting lanes were 2-3 hours for the main attractions - this is obviously is too much for the price you are paying for entrance fees. Therefore value for money is difficult to be judged in a proper way. You can take tons of nice photos and also enjoy the park - however, at one point of time people get tired from waiting and / or walking - restaurants in the park are expensive and not really tasty but fit the purpose - all in all nice place but far away from downtown and other attractions in Shanghai.",4.0,"The review says that the user visited Shanghai Disney for a special occasion but found the long waiting times (2-3 hours) for main attractions very challenging, affecting the perceived value for the money paid for entrance fees. They appreciated the opportunity to take many photos and enjoy the park scenery, but mentioned that the long waits and extensive walking can be tiring. The user also mentioned that while the park-themed restaurants are useful for serving guests, they felt they were not outstanding in terms of cost and taste. Furthermore, the park's distance from Shanghai's downtown and other attractions was seen as a drawback."
"The most beautiful, clean and amazing Disneyland I have ever visited! I have visited every Disneyland in the world and so glad I saved this for last!",5.0,"The review praises this Disneyland park as the most beautiful, clean, and outstanding one the reviewer has ever visited. The reviewer, who has visited every Disneyland across the globe, expressed immense satisfaction, expressing particular happiness about choosing this one as their final visit."
"Any day you will find immensely large crowds but using the app you can pay for the priority queue. In our case for some rides this reduced lines of 2hrs down to 20 mins. Cost is the equivalent of 20 euro per person per ride. Pricey but not worth the wait otherwise (in my view) In the evening, especially during dinner time, the queues get a bit less lengthy which is good. Food is also decent, nothing like the street food crap you would get in EU or US disneyland. Kids loved it. Seems the girls really dress up for this (be prepared for a gazillion princesses) So convenient to be able to get here by metro instead of a long arduous drive. If you want to go shopping there is a disney world shop just outside the park gates which is open one hour longer beyond park closing time.",5.0,"The reviewer suggests the park can be very crowded, but suggests using the app to pay for priority queues which can significantly reduce wait times for rides, albeit at a high cost. The reviewer notes that the queues are shorter during dinner time. They found the food in the park decent, and notably better than what they've experienced at EU or US Disneyland. The park was a hit with their children, particularly the girls who enjoyed dressing like princesses. The reviewer appreciates the convenience of accessing the park by metro, and mentioned a Disney shop located outside the park gates, which is open even after the park closes."
"This is Disneyland, I have been here twice by subway. It is also good to drive, a big parking zone.I suggest you spend a full day here and watch the firework at night.You will never forget this.",5.0,The reviewer had a positive experience visiting Disneyland twice by subway and also recommends driving due to the ample parking available. They suggest spending an entire day at the park and highlight the nighttime fireworks as a memorable feature.
"There are many rides, good atmosphere, cool weather and delicious food.  Just some fun toys  There are princesses and princes who dress up beautifully and handsomely.",5.0,"The review is positive, praising the multiple rides, great atmosphere, pleasant weather, and tasty food at the location. The presence of characters dressed convincingly as princesses and princes was also appreciated."
"I donâ€™t want the public to see the world they live in while theyâ€™re in the park. I want them to feel theyâ€™re in another world â€”Â Walt DisneyChildhood memories captured beautifully. The euphoria from the costumes, songs will magically  transport you to yesteryear.The castle looks magical, the tour was amazing. I loved the parade. The singing was a bit off, but bearable.The food court was packed, the food was okay.Caution, never go during holidays. Went during National holidays. We thought it's a ""rainy"" day, it will not be packed. It cleared up and we got through the lines quicker with passports. But there were long lines everywhere - for rides, food, bathrooms.It was nice seeing kids with the Minnie Mouse ear headbands,  balloons, decor etc.",3.0,"The reviewer expresses a nostalgic appreciation for the experience at the park, noting how the costumes and songs transported them back to their childhood. They found the castle tour and parade impressive, despite some off-key singing. However, they found the food court to be crowded and the food only satisfactory. The reviewer advises against visiting during holidays due to long lines for rides, food, and bathrooms. Despite the crowds, they enjoyed seeing kids with Minnie Mouse headbands and the overall decor."
"Best Disneyland I have been to! (So farâ€¦) I have Been to a variety of Disneylandâ€™s, Paris and a few others, but I would have to Say this was the best one Iâ€™ve been to! It is truly magical and deserves five stars.",5.0,"The user rates this Disneyland as the best they've experienced compared to others, including Paris. They describe it as truly magical and believe it deserves a five-star rating."
"After experiencing Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney Shanghai is a big disappointment.  There don't seem to be any rides and all of the rides they do have, you need to line up for hours just to ride.  We got there and got through the gates just after 10am and left at 8pm and were able to go on only 4 rides!  The parade was very short, with only a couple of floats.  The food up near Iron had a vegan burger which I thought was good.  It has the feel of Disney yet something seems to be missing.",3.0,"The reviewer expressed disappointment with Disney Shanghai after visiting Disney World and Disneyland. They found the park lacking in rides and criticized the long wait times. They spent approximately 10 hours in the park but could only go on four rides. They also found the parade short with only a few floats. On the positive side, they appreciated the food, highlighting a good vegan burger near Iron. They felt the park had a Disney atmosphere but something seemed to be missing."
A pretty magical place.Rides were amazing and the experience smooth and easy even with small kids in tow. Recommend two days and hotel stay to get the most value. Early entry and fast pass invaluable.Dining experience in the park was poor; best eat in the village outside the gates.Fireworks show on Xmas day was an unforgettable experience. Upon leaving my thoughts turns to when I’ll come back…,5.0,"The reviewer had a wonderful experience, describing the place as 'magical' with amazing rides and an easy, smooth experience despite having small kids. They recommend a two-day visit and staying in the hotel for maximum value, emphasizing the importance of the early entry and fast pass. They were disappointed with the dining experience inside the park, recommending to eat in the village outside the park instead. They found the fireworks show on Christmas day unforgettable and express a desire to return."
Lovely visit. Not many exciting rides but nice to walk around. Food is not that good as it is of food court style. Better to dine at Disneytown. Mickey’s Parade was fun. Fireworks display at night was fantastic.,4.0,"The reviewer had an enjoyable visit, although they noted a lack of exciting rides. They didn't particularly enjoy the food court-style meals and suggested dining at Disneytown instead. However, they thoroughly enjoyed Mickey's Parade and the nighttime fireworks display."
"What an amazing magical place especially for Christmas . So great and totally worth a visit , good rides, good food in the town just a magical happy place .",5.0,"The review is highly positive, praising this spot as a wonderful, magical place for Christmas. The visitor enjoyed their experience, mentioning that it's worth visiting due to its excellent rides and good food. They ended on a note of happiness, describing the place as joyous and magical."
"It was pretty good. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but I personally prefer the ones in America as the rides are more exciting.",4.0,The reviewer found the experience enjoyable but they believe the rides in America are more exciting.
"Me and my partner had a bad experience at Disneyland. We purchased two nights at the Toy Story Hotel and tickets for the second day. When we arrived, three members of staff all told us that we needed to go to Disney Town the next morning to collect the tickets. So at 07:00 in the morning, we took a bus to Disney Town..But we were told by the staff there that there was no record or proof that we had purchased the tickets and that we needed to get confirmation from the hotel! So this meant, me and my partner, taking the bus BACK to the hotel only for them to give us tickets to get in to the park. What a mess! It really ruined our mood. At first I thought it could have been a misunderstanding, but we are both fluent in Chinese and English, yet they said the same thing in both languages. Lack of experience? I don't know. But it really ruined our experienced as we didn't get into the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded.",1.0,"The reviewer shares a negative experience at Disneyland and the Toy Story Hotel. There was miscommunication on how and where to collect park tickets, causing them to run back and forth between Disney Town and their hotel early in the morning. Despite being fluent in Chinese and English, language did not seem to be the barrier, leading to confusion on whether it was a lack of experience from the staff. The debacle delayed their entry to the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded, which soured their overall experience."
"Visited the park in 2019, pre-Covid and had a blast.The queues weren’t too bad, as we found out we picked quite a good day for our visit and we were able to enjoy almost all of the attractions we were interested in.Even on a not so busy day, some of the attractions were a bit busy and we were thinking that a fast pass would have been a good idea…but then again, the concept of fast passes is a bit of a wallet burning idea.TRON ride is a unique experience that was something else and we really enjoyed Star Wars hall - the 2 meters high Lord Vader was stealing the show.The Pirates of the Caribbean are also a must, as the visual effects are incredible, especially compared to some European parks.Most of us have been to a few amusement parks and this was one of the better ones - however, you should come prepared, as the prices inside are quite high and English translations are not present everywhere.",5.0,"The reviewer had a great time visiting the park in 2019 before Covid-19 hit. They appreciated their timing as the queues weren’t too long, allowing them to enjoy nearly all rides and attractions. The TRON ride and Star Wars hall, featuring a 2 meter high Lord Vader, were special highlights. They also highly recommend the Pirates of the Caribbean for the impressive visual effects. Despite largely positive sentiments, they suggest investing in a fast pass for busier attractions and warn about high prices inside the park. The lack of English translations throughout the park was also mentioned. Overall, they rated it one of the better amusement parks they've been to."
"I am a huge fan of Florida’s Disney World and have been to Disneyland California and Hong Kong. When I moved to China I was very excited to visit this Disneyland the first chance I had. With that said, while the overall experience was fun and had Disney magic, I was a little disappointed. From what I have read the park had changed post-COVID and not for the better.Bottom Line: if you’re a Disney super fan like me and prepared for huge crowds the beauty and uniqueness of this park is worth it. Otherwise the crowds and long lines without free fastpass make this park a challenge!!Details:1) be prepared for HUGE crowds. We went on a weekday and I would hate to see it on a weekend. LONG lines for everything, even bag check + entry turnstiles took about 1.5 hrs (standing in hot direct sun). 2) We arrived 1.5 hours before park opened and got in 5 minutes after opening. The line for some big rides (Soarin) was already almost 3 hours. They do sell early access passes so this might be worth it but I think with crowds from the resorts entering early it would still be very busy.3) Fastpass. This was the biggest and most frustrating change of all. There are NO free fastpass. You can buy fastpass in packages or for single rides but it’s EXPENSIVE- one pass was 180RMB or about $28!! That’s crazy. And with the giant lines…you have to choose either to just wait or pay up. :/4) As for lines- as a frequent visitor of WDW in Florida I was very surprised that early morning lines were actually longer than late morning-early afternoon. Keep an eye on the wait times in the app and try to ride during the afternoon, parades, etc. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Tron had manageable (1 hr or less) lines during the night shows so this is a good option if you’re not watching the night show. As for the night show, plan to stake out a spot around 6:30 for the 8pm show if you want a decent view of the castle.5) The food is not good and is very expensive (more expensive than WDW). Many people have posted that you can’t bring in food; this is not the case in 2021. We packed plenty of snacks but in hindsight I wish we would have packed actual lunch/dinner food. If you do have to eat in the park, Tangled Tree Tavern wasn’t bad. The slightly better and slightly less expensive food is just outside the park in Disneytown- a separate area you can enter/exit throughout the day with your park ticket. The ice cream in Disneytown is very good and will only set you back about $5 instead of the $10 charged in the park.6) The Tron and Pirate rides are amazing!! Even impressed my husband who is not as much of a Disney fanatic. :)7) The park is beautiful and SO BIG! The attention to detail you expect from Disney was amazing.8) We live in China so we were prepared for “Chinese” behavior, which may come as a shock to other visitors. Yes, there is a lot of pushing and crowding. And we did see one little boy peeing on the pavement in front of the castle. Be prepared for pushing and other things you won’t see in America. It’s just China and it’s shocking and gross but you aren’t in America after all! Also the shows and rides are mostly in Mandarin and staff generally speaks little English.also download the Shanghai Disney app and a good VPN (we use ExpressVPN) before you come.As of July 2021 there are very little COVID measures. You have to buy/book your ticket in advance but there’s no social distancing and infrequent mask wearing.",4.0,"The reviewer was generally happy about the Disney magic at Disneyland Shanghai, but expressed dissatisfaction with the post-COVID changes. They noted that crowds are huge and visitors should be prepared for long lines. Fastpasses are now paid services and quite expensive. They found the food pricey and not tasty, but noted that it's permissible to bring your own food. Some notable attractions were the Tron and Pirate rides, and the beauty of the park was outstanding. Still, they cautioned about some culture shock for foreign visitors, as some behaviors common in China might seem strange or impolite to them. The reviewer recommended utilizing the Shanghai Disney app and a VPN, and warned about limited COVID measures in place as of July 2021."
"I booked a 2 day pass on the official website before arrive in Shanghai (around ¥800 weekday 2 day ticket).The subway line 11 arrives straight into the resort! Make sure you buy a return ticket as soon as you arrive! (it will save time when you return)!Day 1: Great day, weather wasn’t the best! It rained which meant that a few rides were suspended until the storm had passed! There is a parade at 12:15pm which is worth watching! Around a 1 hour and less wait for the rides!Day 2: Another great day, although this was a Friday. The park seemed much busier. There were 1/2 hours waits for the rides!There are a mixture of Chinese and western food! The bakery is a much visit!",5.0,"The reviewer had a positive experience visiting a resort in Shanghai, after pre-booking a 2-day pass for weekdays. Public transportation was convenient, with Subway line 11 leading directly to the location. Day 1 had a bit of rain that caused a few rides to be suspended temporarily, but the wait times were generally short and there was an enjoyable parade. Day 2 was busier, likely due to it being Friday, resulting in slightly longer wait times. The resort offers a mix of Chinese and Western food that appealed to the user, with a particular highlight being the bakery. They recommend purchasing return tickets immediately upon arrival to save time later."
"I don’t understand what is the fuss about with most people who visited Shanghai Disneyland. It’s a theme park and it WILL be crowded from time to time. And this is China. There WILL be people.We visited the park for four consecutive days buying two 2-day tickets each and found this was totally worth it every yuan. The staff at the park are polite, helpful, kind to children and help out however they can. The rides are great! Yes there are queues, and if one plans timings well, like missing the morning parade to do a “Soaring over the Horizon”, or doing TRON during Chinese dinner time, one will find practically no queues. I did buy a fast pass, only because we didn’t want to wait for 60 mins as we wanted to finish Winnie The Pooh ride and go for lunch. It’s a personal choice.If I were only with adults, queues are no big deal, but with little children I preferred a fast pass one day for a chosen ride.Food in the park is good. Limited options for vegetarians like me, but one can always go into Disneytown, eat and come back with the same ticket. It’s allowed! I find that extremely convenient!!!One can never cover everything in the park even after 4 days. It’s really big compared to HK. We loved the park although I wish they should add some specific timings for the English narration of the Pooh ride.We shall return!",5.0,"The reviewer enjoyed their four-day visit to Shanghai Disneyland and thought it was worth every yuan. They found the park to be crowded as expected, but appreciated the polite and helpful staff. The reviewer praised the rides and shared tips on how to avoid long queues by planning timings well. They liked the option of a fast pass, particularly when visiting with small children. They found the food good, but noted limited vegetarian options. Yet, they appreciated the ability to leave and re-enter the park with the same ticket to access Disneytown. The reviewer wished for English narration during the Pooh ride and looks forward to returning as they couldn't cover the whole park in their visit."
